NEW YORK â€” Wal-Mart Stores, the world's largest retailer, reported a 7 percent rise in quarterly profit on Tuesday as discounts drew U.S. shoppers looking for bargains on necessities like food and pharmacy items.
While Wal-Mart said the year was off to a "solid start," it indicated results for the current quarter could miss Wall Street estimates as it faces a tough economic environment, higher transportation costs and customers who are running out of money between paychecks.
"Customers are faced with results of a tougher economy, higher gas prices, food inflation and the increase in the overall cost of living," said Eduardo Castro-Wright, head of Wal-Mart's U.S. operations. "The 'paycheck cycle' is more pronounced as things get tighter for customers toward the end of the month."

WASHINGTON, Jan. 18 - Labor Department officials said on Wednesday that a much-criticized agreement that they had signed with Wal-Mart Stores regarding workplace inspections was allowed to expire last week.
In October, the department's inspector general, Gordon S. Heddell, issued a scathing report on the agreement, in which the department's Wage and Hour Division gave Wal-Mart 15 days notice before inspecting its stores.
The inspector general said the agreement gave Wal-Mart preferential treatment, while many Congressional Democrats and labor groups attacked the agreement, saying it gave Wal-Mart an opportunity to hide child labor and wage violations.

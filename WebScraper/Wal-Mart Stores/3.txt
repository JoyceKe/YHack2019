Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the country's largest retailer, reported another quarter of strong sales and earnings yesterday, continuing to prosper in spite of the stock market's concern that the company's string of successes is almost over.
Wal-Mart, whose shares have been a favorite of short-sellers betting the price will fall, said it sold almost 20 percent more merchandise in the third quarter than it did in the comparable period last year.
Its gross profit margins also increased slightly, although those increases were offset by rising expenses. Analysts have been concerned recently about the company's creeping costs, since Wal-Mart's biggest weapon against its competitors is its extremely low expense structure.
The company told analysts that higher minimum wages and greater benefit costs had raised expenses, as had opening more combination discount-grocery stores and doing more business in merchandise that had higher costs, like health aids and cosmetics.

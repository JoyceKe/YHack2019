Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Ark., said yesterday that net income was $1.03 billion, or 45 cents a share, in the quarter ended Jan. 31, up 19 percent from $868 million, or 38 cents a share, in the corresponding period a year earlier. Sales rose 20 percent, to $24.45 billion.
Analysts said the company's conference call after the release of the results was upbeat. "This is going to be a significant year for them because they should surpass $100 billion in sales," said Walter F. Loeb, an independent retailing analyst.
This year, the 122 Woolco stores in Canada that Wal-Mart purchased from the Woolworth Corporation in 1994 should also turn profitable, and losses generated by the Pace warehouse stores it bought from the Kmart Corporation last year should shrink, said Daniel D. Barry, a retailing analyst with Merrill Lynch.
The company's warehouse stores, called Sam's Clubs, are also expected to show their first healthy increase in comparable-store sales in a couple of years, Mr. Barry said. Comparable-store sales, or sales in stores open at least one year, are considered a better barometer of a retailer's performance because they exclude the impact of new stores.

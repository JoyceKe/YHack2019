Lintas once was an acronym that stood for Lever International Advertising Services, after the marketer Unilever; Lintas was its in-house agency until the agency was acquired by the Interpublic Group of Companies.
In 1994, Interpublic merged Lintas with Ammirati & Puris, forming Ammirati Puris Lintas. The company then merged that agency with Lowe & Partners in 1999 to form Lowe Lintas. Lowe will continue to be a unit of the Partnership division of Interpublic.

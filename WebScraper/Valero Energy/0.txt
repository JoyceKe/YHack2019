The Valero Energy Corporation agreed to sell a refinery in San Francisco to gain Federal Trade Commission approval for its $5.4 billion takeover of the Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corporation. Valero will sell the Golden Eagle Refinery in the San Francisco Bay area and 70 Beacon and Ultramar gasoline stations in Northern California, the company said. Ultramar bought the refinery from the Tosco Corporation for $950 million last year. Regulators are concerned that too few companies will control gasoline refining and sales in California.

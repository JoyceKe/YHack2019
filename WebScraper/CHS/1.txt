CHS Electronics Inc., the largest personal-computer distributor in Europe and Latin America, is renegotiating its offer for Vobis Microcomputer A.G., Europe's largest computer retailer, and may abandon the bid. The Miami-based CHS and Metro A.G., Vobis's parent, are considering three options. Metro may partly finance the acquisition, the companies may extend the deadline for payment or the agreement may be scrapped, said Craig Toll, CHS's chief financial officer. In July, CHS agreed to pay $320 million in cash and stock. It also said it would assume $350 million in debt.

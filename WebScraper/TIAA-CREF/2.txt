The marketer is TIAA-CREF, which provides investment and pension services to workers in fields like academia, culture and medicine, offering products like mutual funds and IRAÂs. The second round of the TIAA-CREF campaign Â produced again by the companyÂs creative agency, Modernista in Boston Â is appearing on television, with print, radio and online advertising to follow.
The campaign brings back many of the elements from 2004, like the theme, ÂFinancial services for the greater goodÂ; the music heard in the commercials, ÂSomewhereÂ from ÂWest Side StoryÂ; and the same voice-over announcer, an actor named Michael Massee who sounds like Michael Douglas channeling Christian Slater channeling Jack Nicholson.
But there are numerous differences, too. Among them: using instrumental versions of ÂSomewhereÂ rather than vocals, hiring a new director for the commercials, rewriting the narrations spoken by Mr. Massee, even filming the spots with more close-up shots.
One school calls for freshening campaigns frequently so they do not wear out their welcome. For instance, results released last week from a study known as Project Wanamaker showed that viewers grew tired sooner of seeing the same commercials over and over than marketers had expected.
On the other hand, given the challenges of the competitive market place, changing the contents of campaigns too often or too much can lead to the loss of whatever attention was generated by the previous iterations.
ÂThe first phase of our advertising campaign last year was to raise awareness among participants and prospects, and it was tremendously successful,Â she adds, citing data like a 23 percent increase in advertising awareness among people who have money invested with TIAA-CREF.
ÂThis year, we want to take the message a little bit further,Â Ms. Harnick says, and Âbuild on the emotional connection we started to makeÂ with current and potential customers by reiterating that Âwe know you, we understand you and the ins and outs of your daily life.Â
For example, when a commercial last year showed a professor in a long shot speaking Âin a grand hall filled with hundreds of students,Â Ms. Harnick says, a new commercial Âshows the dedication of a professor working one-on-one with a student,Â filmed in close-ups in a small office.
The other new commercials are more intimate, too. One depicts a doctor being awakened by his pager just as he tries to take a nap on a gurney. Another spot shows a nurse caring for an elderly patient as her family comes to visit her room.
A third commercial presents a close-up of a woman painting a set backstage at a theater, then pulls back to show the set being installed on the stage and how it looks from the audience. A fourth commercial features a groundskeeper at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, Calif., who interrupts his work to return a stray football.
All the commercials were directed by Errol Morris, a film maker known for his up-close-and-personal style. His work includes ÂThe Fog of War,Â ÂThe Thin Blue LineÂ and a series of spots last year that presented Republicans discussing why they would not vote for President Bush.
ÂWe liked what we did last year and felt it was really good for the brand,Â says Lance Jensen, executive creative director at Modernista. ÂWe didnÂt want to lose what we felt were the beginnings of a pretty good brand voice.Â
The decision to replace the vocal versions of ÂSomewhereÂ with the instrumental versions grew from a realization that the narrator needed to say more than last time about TIAA-CREF and its offerings.
ÂItÂs never an easy thing to describe what a financial services company does,Â Mr. Jensen says, Âlet alone one with specific expertise and customersÂ like TIAA-CREF, and to add more words meant Âwe have too much voice-over in this iteration to have people singing.Â
In the commercial about the professor, Mr. Massee says: ÂFor all the extra hours you dedicate to your students, we think you deserve some extra credit. TIAA-CREF. Serving the needs of those in the academic, medical, cultural and research fields. Visit us online to find out how we can serve you.Â A Web address, tiaa-cref.org/greatergood, is superimposed onscreen.
In the spot about the groundskeeper, Mr. Massee declares, ÂItÂs unlikely your uniform will ever be retired, but maybe it should be.Â He voices a similar thought in the spot about the set designer: ÂYour name may never appear on the marquee or up in lights, but maybe it should.Â
Just like last year, all the workers in the new commercials are actual professionals in those fields, recruited from the Los Angeles area where the spots were filmed at sites like the Rose Bowl, the Los Angeles Theater and the University of Southern California.
Asked why the campaign uses real people, Mr. Jensen replies rhetorically, ÂWhy fake it?Â and adds: ÂNo one grows up and says, ÂI want to be a car salesman.Â People grow up and say, ÂI want to be a teacher,Â ÂI want to be a doctor.Â These are careers of childhood dreams.Â
The commercials have been running since Aug. 8 on broadcast and cable networks, during shows like ÂCold Case,Â ÂThe Daily Show with Jon Stewart,Â ÂGood Morning America,Â ÂHouseÂ and ÂLate Night with Conan OÂBrien.Â They will run through the fall nationally, adding college basketball and football telecasts, as well as in local markets like Boston, Detroit, New York, Philadelphia and Seattle.
The print ads will run in newspapers as well as in magazines like Black Enterprise, Business Week, The New Yorker, Real Simple, RunnerÂs World and U.S. News & World Report. The online ads will be on Web sites like chronicleofhighered.com, discovery.com, insidehighered.com, nytimes.com and yahoo.com.
TargetCast TCM in New York continues as the media services agency for TIAA-CREF, which spent more than $45 million last year on advertising in major media and about $40 million through the first six months of 2005.

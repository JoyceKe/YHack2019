TIAA-CREF, the financial services company that sells mutual funds, has placed its account in review. The account has been handled for more than 15 years by Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide in New York, part of the WPP Group. Billings were estimated at $20 million.
Brian Browdie, a spokesman for TIAA-CREF in New York, confirmed reports of the review in Adweek and Advertising Age. Ogilvy has been invited to take part, Mr. Browdie said, but he declined to discuss who else may be invited to participate. A spokeswoman for Ogilvy, Toni Lee, said the agency would take part. Mr. Browdie said the review would be a compact process but declined to specify how long it may take.

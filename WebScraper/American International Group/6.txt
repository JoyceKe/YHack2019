American International Group said yesterday that Jeffrey W. Greenberg, an executive vice president and a son of its chairman and chief executive, Maurice R. Greenberg, was resigning after 17 years with the insurance company.
Mr. Greenberg, who was in charge of domestic property and casualty operations, had been thought to be a potential successor to his father, who is 70. But in recent months, he had begun to be overshadowed by his younger brother, Evan.
Indeed, the resignation comes less than two weeks after Evan Greenberg, who is 40, was named an executive vice president, his third promotion in 16 months. He retained his other title as president of American International Underwriters, which oversees the insurer's property and casualty business.
The resignation has the earmarks of an unpleasant corporate development. The announcement was not released by A.I.G. until almost 5:30 P.M.. And in a statement, Jeffrey Greenberg said he was leaving with no immediate plans for his future.
"Having been devoted to my responsibilities at A.I.G., I have not taken the time to evaluate my options," he said. "I look forward to doing so over the next several months, while also spending time with my wife and children."
A.I.G. said that Jeffrey Greenberg would be succeeded in its domestic brokerage group by William D. Smith. A senior vice president, Mr. Smith has also served as president of its National Union Fire Insurance Company subsidiary since 1991.

Humana Inc. said yesterday that profits from health maintenance organizations and other managed care operations rose sharply in the three months that ended on Feb. 28. It was the final quarter that included results from Humana's aborted effort to keep hospitals filled with patients from its own H.M.O.'s.
Galen Health Care Inc., the troubled hospital chain that Humana spun off to shareholders on March 1, showed another earnings decline. Galen set up shop a few blocks from Humana's headquarters in Louisville, Ky.
Humana's attempt to mesh hospitals and H.M.O.'s, which was initially hailed by health-care analysts, foundered on a built-in conflict: Prepaid health plans thrive to the extent that they can keep their members out of expensive hospital beds. Moreover, Humana's aggressive cost controls squeezed independent doctors, who often retaliated by placing patients in non-Humana hospitals.

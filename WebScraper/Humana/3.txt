Humana Inc. said that it expected to take fourth-quarter charges of $175 million to $225 million, and that it had lowered its earnings estimate to 34 to 36 cents a share, exclusive of special items, from 58 cents a year earlier. Humana said the after-tax charges were a result of dividing into two separate companies and a decline in operating results. Under the proposed plan, a company would be spun off to own and operate Humana hospitals, while Humana Health Care Plans would be owned and operated by Humana Inc.

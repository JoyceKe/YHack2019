Humana Inc., the managed health care company, said yesterday that first-quarter earnings doubled as government revenue rose. The shares fell after the company said higher medical claims in one account would reduce profit.
Net income increased to $67.8 million, or 41 cents a share, from $31.2 million, or 19 cents a share, a year earlier, the company said. Earnings per share matched the average estimate of analysts surveyed by Thomson Financial. Sales rose 12 percent, to $3.3 billion.
Medical costs rose to 84.4 cents of a premium dollar, from 83.4 cents a year earlier. Humana is trying to curb spending as medical expenses rise for one of the company's large municipal customers. The increase in that account may trim profit by $30 million this year, Humana said.
The Morgan Stanley Health Care Payer Index fell as much as 2.6 percent after Humana said competitors are offering discounts to get business, a prospect that investors fear may hurt profits in the industry.

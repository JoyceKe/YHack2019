The stock of Humana Inc., the hospital management company that once dazzled institutional investors, has sagged from its 1985 peak of $36.25 a share to less than $23 this week. An earnings recovery that many analysts had predicted for this year has not materialized, and the question now is whether earnings will rebound at all.
''We've all had to reassess and retreat on Humana,'' said David H. Talbot of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. Mr. Talbot expects earnings of $2.10 to $2.13 a share for the 1986 fiscal year, and projects 1987 earnings of between $2.25 and $2.40. Humana earned $2.19 a share in 1985.
While all hospital management companies have struggled with declining hospital admissions, Humana's current problems run deeper. The company's insurance plan, CarePlus, which was designed to bolster admissions by funneling patients into Humana's hospitals, will lose in the neighborhood of $70 million this year, analysts say.
Todd B. Richter of Morgan Stanley & Company, one of the few analysts who is recommending the stock now, minimizes CarePlus's losses, pointing out that the plan has enabled Humana to raise its admissions while ''everyone else's occupancy rates are dropping through the floor.''
Mr. Talbot likes Humana as a long-term play. With the stock at depressed levels, ''the downside is nominal and the upside is quite significant,'' he said. Mr. Hindelong is less optimistic: ''A lot has to be done with the product to make Humana's earnings match the earnings that most of the others in the industry will reach.''

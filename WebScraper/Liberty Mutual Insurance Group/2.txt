The Liberty Mutual Insurance Company has narrowed a review on its account to four agencies from nine. The account, with billings estimated at $27 million, had been handled for 11 years by Wells BDDP in New York, part of GGT Group, until that agency was dismissed as the review began in January.
John Cusolito, assistant vice president for Liberty Mutual in Boston, confirmed reports in Advertising Age and Adweek that the review had been narrowed to Mullen Advertising in Wenham, Mass., and three agencies in New York: N. W. Ayer & Partners, part of MacManus Group; Kirshenbaum Bond & Partners, and Lowe & Partners/SMS, part of the Lowe Group unit of the Interpublic Group of Companies. A decision is expected by early April, he said.

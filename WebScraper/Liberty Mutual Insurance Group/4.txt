Liberty Mutual, the country's largest writer of workers' compensation insurance, said Mr. Kelly had been hired for his broad background and track record of successes. At Aetna, Mr. Kelly was most recently a group executive, overseeing many financial products and building the managed health care business.
Mr. Kelly's task at Liberty Mutual, where he starts on April 1, will include developing those products, but he acknowledges that he will be joining the company with little personal experience in workers' compensation.
Mr. Kelly said his strategy for his new post had not yet been formed. The workers' compensation field holds special challenges because the laws are different in each state. The system, a way to reimburse employees for economic hardships resulting from injuries and illnesses caused on the job, is an industry marked by soaring expenses. In the last decade, the costs of the insurance programs in all 50 states have risen roughly 150 percent, an increase attributed largely to rising medical expenses, litigation fees and the cost of expanding benefits.
Mr. Kelly joined Aetna in 1974 and held senior-level positions in its employee benefits division. As part of a corporate reorganization in 1991, Mr. Kelly was named one of four group executives sharing the majority of operating responsibilities.
Mr. Kelly graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology with a Ph.D. in mathematics in 1970. He will be relocating to the Boston area from his home in Simsbury, Conn., where he lives with his wife, Debbie. They have one adult daughter.

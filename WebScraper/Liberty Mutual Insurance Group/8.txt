The Liberty Mutual Insurance Company has named Kirshenbaum Bond & Partners in New York to handle its account, with billings estimated at $27 million. The account had been handled for 12 years by Wells BDDP in New York until that agency was dismissed when a review began in January.
John Cusolito, assistant vice president of Liberty Mutual in Boston, said the review began with 10 agencies -- excluding Wells BBDP, now owned by Omnicom Group, which is scheduled to close next month. It had been narrowed to four agencies and further narrowed to Kirshenbaum Bond and one other finalist, N. W. Ayer & Partners in New York, part of MacManus Group.
Separately, the Centraal Corporation in Palo Alto, Calif., named Kirshenbaum Bond & Partners West in San Francisco as the first agency to handle integrated communications for its Real Name internet navigation system. Billings were estimated at $2 million. The decision came after a six-week review that included two other unidentified agencies.

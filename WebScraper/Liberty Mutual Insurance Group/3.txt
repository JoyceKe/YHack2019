An investment group led by the Continental Casualty Company, a unit of the CNA Financial Corporation, has sold its entire 5.8 percent stake in Liberty All-Star Equity Fund. The sale by the Continental group is a blow to certain of the mutual fund's shareholders, who are planning a shareholder vote to convert Liberty All-Star Equity Fund from a closed-end fund, with a fixed number of shares, to an open-end fund.
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Continental group gave no reason for the sale of the shares. The Continental group had been planning to vote in support of the dissident shareholders. According to a separate S.E.C. filing, a large portion of the Continental shares was purchased by the Liberty Mutual Insurance Company and the Liberty Mutual Fire Insurance Company, which said it would vote against proposals ''to change the nature and central features of Liberty All-Star.'' The fund's shares slipped 25 cents today, to $7.125, on the New York Stock Exchange.

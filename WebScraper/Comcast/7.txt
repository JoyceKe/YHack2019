Comcast’s programming unit — including the cable networks E!, Style, Versus, G4, and the Golf Channel — is doing well. It reported a 27 percent increase in third-quarter revenue yesterday, to $330 million.
Advertising revenue also increased 7 percent to $407 million. But those gains were the exception, not the norm, for Comcast. The company “posted a 54 percent drop in quarterly net profit as fierce competition caused it to lose more basic video subscribers than expected, sending its shares down 10 percent on Thursday,” Reuters summarized. Cable companies are feeling pressure from both satellite companies and telephone operators. “In 2006, cable was the darling and could do no wrong,” Alan Gould, media analyst for Natixis Bleichroeder, told Variety. “But in 2007 the growth story has definitely come under some question. People aren’t completely sure now about the delivery of content being through cable.”

There has been industry speculation for more than a year that Comcast may develop a network if it acquires a new package of eight late-season National Football League games on Thursday and Saturday nights.
The speculation had escalated recently with reports that Comcast was interested in acquiring National Hockey League rights for its Outdoor Life Network, and then expanding O.L.N. into an ESPN rival with the football package.
Regarding Comcast's ambitions for O.L.N., which set ratings records for the channel with last month's Tour de France coverage, Burke said only that the company was trying to add programming to it to "make it a better channel."
He did not say if Comcast was still pursuing the N.F.L. deal, which is not likely to be sold until after the league finalizes a new collective bargaining agreement to replace the one that expires after the 2007 season.

The move will help Walgreen expand its online reach. In addition to Walgreens.com, the drugstore chain introduced an app for the iPhone last year and a mobile Web site, services that include sending a text message to consumers when prescriptions are ready.
“Our acquisition of Drugstore.com today significantly accelerates our online strategy to leverage the best community store network in America by becoming the most convenient choice for health and daily living needs whether customers shop online or in our stores,” Walgreen’s chief executive, Greg Wasson, said in a statement.
The deal, which was unanimously approved by drugstore.com’s board, is set to close by June 2011. Walgreen expects the deal to dilute its earnings per share by about 3 cents a share from the fourth quarter this year through fiscal year 2012, and then by 1 to 2 cents a share in fiscal year 2013.
Walgreen was advised by Credit Suisse and the law firms Sidley Austin and Weil Gotshal & Manges. Drugstore.com was advised by Allen & Company, Sonenshine Partners and the law firm Wilson Sonsini Goodrich & Rosati.

The Austin, Tex., personal computer maker reported it had net income of $41.4 million, or 93 cents a share. Wall Street had been expecting about 87 cents a share. The higher earnings came on revenue of $884.6 million, as Dell increased sales of notebook computers and servers.
But investors apparently focused on Dell's gross profit margin, which totaled 20.5 percent of sales in the third quarter, up from 17.9 percent a year earlier but down from 21.4 percent in the second quarter.
Analysts also attributed the selloff to nervous investors who feared that the profit turnaround that propelled Dell's stock up more than 78 percent in the last three months might be over. Dell faces mounting competition in the market for high-end computers powered by the Intel Corporation's Pentium microprocessor.

"In those days, you went through 8 weeks (!!!!) of paid training at the Round Rock, TX campus before you talked to customers on the phone. Techs had ownership of calls, and 'fdisk and format' was the absolute last ditch to fix a problem. Times have changed quite a bit.

There are new and bewildering ways to corrupt a machine's configuration to the point to where a reformat is probably a pretty appealing option."

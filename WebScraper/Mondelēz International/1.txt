“We respect his more than 40 years of business and investment experience as well as his expertise helping consumer products companies leverage their brands and improve operating and financial performance,” Irene Rosenfeld, the chairman and chief executive of Mondelez, said in a statement on the company’s website. “We welcome his input as we deliver superior shareholder returns.”
Mr. Peltz will be the 12th member of Mondelez’s board and will be included in the company’s nominees for election at its annual shareholder meeting later this year. Mondelez, based in Deerfield, Ill., reported revenue of $35 billion in 2012.
Trian had pushed for a merger between PepsiCo and Mondelez, which owns Cadbury chocolate and other brands, in a white paper the company issued last July. In it, Mr. Peltz criticized Pepsi’s “slow-growth” beverage business (the Americas beverage unit declined 4.5 percent in 2012) and urged the company to consider a merger with Mondelez. After a merger, Trian said, it wanted Pepsi to spin off its snack operations into a new entity that would house the Frito-Lay, Cadbury, Oreo and Nabisco brands under one roof.
Trian owns a stake in both PepsiCo and Mondelez, which fueled merger speculation at the time. The white paper went on to suggest that if Pepsi was not interested in a merger with Mondelez, it should consider separating its snack and beverage units.

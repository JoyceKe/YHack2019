The changes are the latest effort by a stalwart of corporate America to change how it evaluates employees. Some companies, like Microsoft and Morgan Stanley’s longtime rival Goldman Sachs, have made their own changes, which have also included getting rid of numerical ratings.
For Morgan Stanley, annual reviews are still helpful in determining how well employees do their jobs. But the current system — in which staff members were asked roughly eight questions and ranked, in addition to being questioned about “areas for development” — was in need of a change.
Morgan Stanley will also put in place a dashboard that compiles all the information needed by supervisors to evaluate employees — like metrics measuring their behavior and data from risk and control functions — in one place.
But the timeline for reviews will change. This month, Morgan Stanley employees will meet with their supervisors for face-to-face midyear performance reviews, rather than receive written ones. In November, managers will meet with and discuss the full 360-degree reviews with their staff members before submitting them and deciding on promotions and compensation.
The move away from numerical scales toward adjectives was rooted in the practices of James P. Gorman, the firm’s chief executive, who has sought in recent years more effective ways of evaluating prospective and current employees.
His experiment started several years ago, when he began asking job candidates to name five of their positive attributes. Last year, he expanded his test by asking his operating committee to try the new system.
Despite suggestions that similar changes at other companies were prompted in part by an effort to appeal to younger workers, Morgan Stanley executives said that was not behind their decision. After all, they noted, Mr. Gorman’s circle of lieutenants is made up of parents of those kinds of workers.

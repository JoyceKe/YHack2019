Prudential Financial said yesterday that quarterly profit rose 34 percent as the company made more from annuities and investment losses fell. Net income climbed to $127 million, or 25 cents a share, from $95 million, or 19 cents, a year earlier, the company said. Excluding investment gains and losses, profit rose 24 percent to $358 million, or 67 cents a share, above the 60-cent estimate by analysts. The chief executive, Arthur F. Ryan, is shedding businesses like car and home insurance to focus on annuities and life insurance.

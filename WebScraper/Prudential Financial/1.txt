Prudential Financial, the life insurer, agreed yesterday to pay about $400 million for the fund management arms of the Hyundai Group of South Korea, expanding its operations there. The company, based in New York, is buying the Hyundai Investment and Securities Company, which has 90 branches, and its Hyundai Investment Trust Management unit, which manages about $14 billion in assets, the insurer said in a statement. It already owns Prudential Life Insurance in Korea. The transaction culminates more than a year of talks with South Korea's government.

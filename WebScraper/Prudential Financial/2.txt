Prudential Financial has been trying for years to figure out what to do with its small, struggling equity research and sales business. Yesterday, the company said it had decided to shut the operation.
The company, based in Newark, had been downsizing and restructuring the division for years, dabbling in investment banking and the retail brokerage sector, which could support the research and trading operations. But the division never found its niche, and the company exited investment banking and retail brokerage, leaving research and sales as a corporate orphan.
“We were not able to reach the scale we wanted to in the long term,” said Theresa Miller, a Prudential spokeswoman. “The company couldn’t get as large as we wanted, and we didn’t see significant growth in the future.”
Prudential estimates that closing the division will cost $110 million, including $75 million in severance packages and other employee-related costs. The company said it would record the costs in this quarter.
Prudential joined the securities business in 1981 when it purchased Bache Halsey Stuart Shields, which it renamed Prudential-Bache Securities and later just Prudential Securities. The company shut its investment banking operation in 2000, and the division adopted its current name after it sold a majority of its retail brokerage business to Wachovia Securities in 2003.
The unit struggled to compete with larger companies like Goldman Sachs and Merrill Lynch as the equity research business became more competitive and less profitable. Large overhead expenses, costs it once shared with the profitable brokerage business, weighed down the relatively small division’s profit, said Jeffrey Schuman, an analyst at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods.

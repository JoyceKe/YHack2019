Added to the $20.5 billion from the initial public offering of A.I.A., that brings the bailed-out insurers take to $36.7 billion, a major step toward paying down the many billions it still owes Washington.
The Treasury Department said in response to the A.I.G. statement that it would provide an additional $22 billion in Troubled Asset Relief Program funds to buy the New York Federal Reserve’s stake in the special purpose vehicles that hold the A.I.G. units.
The restructuring will bring the Treasury’s stake in A.I.G. to 92.1 percent, and the 1.66 billion shares of A.I.G. common stock it owns are worth $69.5 billion, it said, far in excess of its $47.5 billion cash investment in the company.
Nevertheless, that $47.5 billion is only a fraction of the total bailout. The restructuring is expected to finish by the end of the first quarter next year — after which the Treasury can sell A.I.G. shares on the open market.
“As we said on Sept. 30, A.I.G. will restructure itself around its core property casualty and life and retirement services businesses, which are performing well,” said Robert Benmosche, A.I.G.’s chief.
The American Life Insurance Company, known as Alico, operates in more than 50 countries in Asia, the Middle East and Europe, and with its acquisition, MetLife’s operations will extend to 60 countries and 90 million customers, it said in a statement.

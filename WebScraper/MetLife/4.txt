MetLife Inc., the big United States insurer, said today that it was acquiring a Brazilian insurer, Seguradora America do Sul S.A., for an undisclosed amount, doubling its market share in Brazil, which has Latin America's largest economy.
MetLife signed an agreement to acquire Seasul, as the Brazilian insurer and pension company is called, from Banco America do Sul S.A. and merge with its Brazilian subsidiary. The purchase will put MetLife among the 15 largest insurers in Brazil, MetLife said.

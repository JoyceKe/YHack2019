In a recent post for The New Yorker, Adam Gopnik argued that Adam Smith, the father of capitalism, thought prosperity depended on “what might be called niceness.” Even if a “wise producer” can make more money by hiring children or looting someone’s pension fund, he won’t, because he knows such actions “will break the bonds of common sympathy, the sense that we’re all in this together, on which the producer’s…well-being ultimately depends.” Smith was also a great believer in decent wages: “the high price of labor,” Smith once wrote, “is the essence of public opulence.”
Compare Smith’s brand of capitalism with the one apparent in today’s Times story on Caterpillar, a manufacturing company that earned a record $4.9 billion profit last year and projected better results for 2012—yet “is insisting on a six-year wage freeze and a pension freeze for most of the 780 production workers at its factory” in Joliet, Illinois. Caterpillar says the freeze is necessary because its unionized workers are paid above market rates. The unionized workers see the situation rather differently—they point out that the $4.9 billion in profit translates to $39,000 in profit per employee—and have called a strike.

ON a list of animals that can scat in a hurry to get out of the way of danger, one would not expect to see the caterpillar's name. But an English anatomist says at least one caterpillar, the larva of the mother-of-pearl moth, is adept at high-speed escapes.
Of course, high speed is a relative term when applied to such a deliberate crawler. In fact, caterpillars can walk at only 10 percent of the maximum speed of running insects of the same weight, said Dr. John Brackenbury, an anatomist at Cambridge University.
But when the mother-of-pearl moth caterpillar faces a challenge, Dr. Brackenbury reported in a recent issue of the journal Nature, it uses some locomotion tricks, like galloping in reverse. The caterpillar's reverse gallop looks much like its forward crawl, but the caterpillar can retreat faster than it can crawl forward, even becoming airborne for short spurts.
And when the caterpillar is sorely provoked, it zooms backward in what Dr. Brackenbury called a recoil-and-roll maneuver. Looking much like a cartoon snake, it forms a hoop and rolls away from the problem at a rate 40 times its normal walking speed. It is an effective strategy, at least for predators with a short reach. The caterpillar can manage such speed -- nearly one mile an hour -- only briefly, for about five revolutions.

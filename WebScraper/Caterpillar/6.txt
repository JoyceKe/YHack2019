Shaped something like an accordion, the tobacco hornworm caterpillar moves one segment at a time. First, the back legs on the last segment step forward, then the second-to-last segment and so on until finally the front segment with its head moves forward.
Researchers at Tufts University and Virginia Tech were curious about the interior biomechanics of this form of movement, so they stuck the caterpillars on a treadmill within a powerful X-ray light source at Argonne National Laboratory in Illinois.
“It amazes me and blows my mind that there are still very unusual things to discover about such a humble creature,” said Michael A. Simon, a researcher at Tufts University in Boston who is the lead author of a paper describing the caterpillar locomotion, to be published in the journal Current Biology.
While the caterpillar crawled one segment at a time on the outside, the entire length of the gut shortened when the rear segment moved forward, then lengthened again as the head made its step forward. “It’s a very interesting form of locomotion,” Dr. Simon said. “In the middle, nothing is synchronized.”
And what it unquestionably shows is the caterpillar in the children’s book “The Very Hungry Caterpillar” is not a tobacco hornworm. The title character scrunches up its middle in a U-shape as it moves. That is how an inchworm (a smaller caterpillar) crawls.

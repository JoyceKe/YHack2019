Those were among the topics that were explored on Thursday at The New York Times’s DealBook D.C. Summit in Washington. Andrew Ross Sorkin, DealBook’s founder, along with several of The Times’s leading journalists, moderated a series of workshops with business and policy leaders, providing fresh insights on how these tensions — and others — will shape the global economy.
Mr. Sorkin also sat down with Brad Smith, the president of Microsoft, and discussed encryption, national security and the increasing likelihood of industry regulation. Mr. Smith is the author, along with Carol Ann Browne of a new book, “Tools and Weapons: The Promise and the Peril of the Digital Age,” which argues for closer cooperation between the tech sector and the government.

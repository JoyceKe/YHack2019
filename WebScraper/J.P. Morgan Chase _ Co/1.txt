J.P. Morgan Chase & Company said yesterday that it would buy Citicorp Electronic Financial Services, a unit of Citigroup, for $380 million in cash to expand its payment card services. The new unit, which sells prepaid payment cards used in place of food stamps, adds to J.P. Morgan's wholesale payment services operations, the bank said in a statement. The purchase follows J.P. Morgan's acquisition this month of the corporate trust unit of the Bank One Corporation for $720 million.

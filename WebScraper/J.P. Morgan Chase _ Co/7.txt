J.P. Morgan Chase & Company said yesterday that the Securities and Exchange Commission's Midwest office might recommend filing suit against the company's Bank One Corporation unit and a former employee. The S.E.C. told the company last month that it was considering making accusations that Bank One, which J.P. Morgan bought last year, and the unidentified employee violated securities laws involving service as an indenture trustee, J.P. Morgan said in a filing with the S.E.C. J.P. Morgan, based in New York, said in the same filing that it would pay $356 million to settle investors' lawsuits in an Oklahoma district court.

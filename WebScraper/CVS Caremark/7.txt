An investment advisory firm is calling for the board of CVS/Caremark to remove a director, Roger L. Headrick, amid concern that his re-election was aided by “phantom votes,” or votes cast without guidance from shareholders.
At issue are corporate voting rules that permit brokerage firms to cast votes in director elections on behalf of investors who fail to provide specific voting instructions. “Broker votes,” as they are also called, have long been criticized as legalized ballot stuffing because they are often automatically cast in favor of the board.
Excluding broker votes, 57 percent of the votes may have been cast against Mr. Headrick’s election, according to estimates by CtW Investment Group, the investment arm of the labor federation Change to Win. CtW also called on CVS/Caremark yesterday to provide an accounting of how broker votes affected the election, which was held Wednesday.
A CVS/Caremark spokeswoman, Carolyn Castel, declined to confirm or deny the estimate, saying that broker votes were spread among the votes cast for and against the directors. CVS/Caremark published updated voting data late Wednesday showing that Mr. Headrick had received 42.7 percent no votes, short of the majority needed for him to resign.
Shareholders waged a no-vote campaign against Mr. Headrick and a fellow director, C. A. Lance Piccolo, saying that they had failed to push for a higher price when negotiating the sale of Caremark Rx to CVS. Both were directors at Caremark.

Coram provides infusion therapies for the treatment of acute and chronic ailments like immune deficiencies, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and nutritional deficiencies to more than 20,000 patients each month, primarily at their homes. It also has a network of more than 85 infusion sites.
“Bringing together CVS Caremark’s unique range of specialty pharmacy services with Coram’s infusion capabilities will expand our competitive offerings in the specialty arena,” Jonathan Roberts, the president of CVS Caremark Pharmacy Services, said in a statement. “Infusion will be a valuable component of our broad specialty pharmacy offering going forward.”
Coram is expected to generate $1.4 billion in revenue during the first year after the deal closes, which is expected by the end of the first quarter of 2014, the statement said. Including one-time transaction and integration costs, the deal is not expected to affect CVS Caremark’s financial results in 2014 but will add 3 to 5 cents to adjusted earnings per share in 2015.
Barclays served as CVS Caremark’s financial adviser, while Sullivan & Cromwell served as legal adviser. Apria was advised Goldman Sachs and Blackstone Advisory Partners, and received legal advice from Simpson Thacher & Bartlett.

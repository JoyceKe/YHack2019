The FedEx Corporation, which acquired the Kinko's chain of 1,200 copy shops late last year, announced a branding strategy yesterday in which the stores will be called FedEx Kinko's Office and Print Centers. FedEx has earmarked $40 million to market the new brand, $25 million of it to be spent in the fiscal year starting June 1, and will introduce national advertising in late summer. Frederick W. Smith, Fedex's chairman, and Gary M. Kusin, president of FedEx Kinko's, presented the new brand at an employee event yesterday in Dallas.

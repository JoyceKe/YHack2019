Allstate reported a sharp increase in third-quarter profit yesterday after a summer with no hurricanes. Analysts said the results were a harbinger for a record performance by the property casualty insurance industry in 2006.
The company, the second-largest home and auto insurer after State Farm, said it earned $1.16 billion, in contrast to a loss of $1.5 billion for the same quarter last year after Hurricane Katrina and other storms destroyed or damaged more than 300,000 homes and businesses insured by Allstate.
Edward M. Liddy, the chief executive of Allstate, said in an interview that strong results were producing excess cash and that Allstate was buying back $3 billion of its shares. Such a step often increases share value.
Allstate's stock closed down 19 cents at $63.30 yesterday. But that was a 14 percent increase from $55.75 on Aug. 1, when the industry's share prices began rising as fears of a bad hurricane season began to ease. On average, property insurance stocks were up 10 percent yesterday from Aug. 1, Mr. Klauber said.
Insurance experts said last week that they expected record profits of $60 billion for the industry in 2006, up from $43 billion in 2005 even after paying for damage in Hurricane Katrina and other storms.
The insurers ended 2005 with a big gain because of strong investment earnings and exceptional profits on auto insurance, workers' compensation, general liability and coverage on homes away from the coasts.
Allstate reported an annual profit in 2005 of $1.8 billion, mostly because of strong earnings on auto insurance, said Kevin Callahan, a portfolio manager at Century Funds in Boston, which owns 40,000 shares of Allstate.
Mr. Liddy said he expected record annual earnings for Allstate in 2006 of $4.8 billion to $5 billion -- about the same as Allstate's losses from hurricanes in 2005. Altogether, property insurers paid out $61 billion for hurricane damage in 2005.
Allstate and other insurers raised prices along the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Mexico after heavy hurricane losses in 2004 and 2005 and forecasts for this year of about a dozen hurricanes. The worst storm has been Tropical Storm Ernesto, which reached hurricane strength briefly over water but hit land in Florida in late August with winds well below hurricane force. No major storms are expected in the remaining six weeks of the hurricane season.
Allstate has led home insurers in combining price increases with cuts in coverage along the coasts. In Florida alone, Allstate has refused to renew 215,000 policies. It is not renewing nearly 40,000 policies in New York.
Consumer advocates say prices on the coasts are excessive. "Insurers like Allstate are using last year's catastrophes as an excuse to jack up rates and, at the same time, cut back coverage," said Birny Birnbaum, the executive director of the Center for Economic Justice in Austin, Tex.

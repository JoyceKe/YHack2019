The Allstate Insurance Company said today that it had agreed to pay $5 million to about 3,100 women currently or formerly employed as sales agents or trainees in settlement of a class action lawsuit accusing the company of discrimination.
The suit, filed in 1975 by Lola Kouba, formerly a sales agent in Sacramento, Calif., charged that the company violated the 1964 Civil Rights Act by giving her a guaranteed starting salary that was less than male agents received.
Despite the settlement agreement, Allstate maintains that it did not discriminate in the past and that the guaranteed starting salary was based on numerous factors, including previous experience, ability and education, as well as prior salary.
''Allstate has had a new marketing program under study for a number of years,'' the company said in a statement. ''It is ready to be introduced on Oct. 1, 1984, and its introduction gives us the opportunity to reach a settlement in the Kouba case, thus ending what looked to be years of expensive litigation.
''Under our new plan, all sales agent trainees and agents within the same market area will receive the same guarantee at the start of their careers. Neither the former guarantee program nor the program to be introduced Oct. 1, 1984, place any limitation on the amount an agent can earn through the sales of Allstate products. This applies equally to men and women.''

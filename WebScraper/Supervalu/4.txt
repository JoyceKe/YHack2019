Supervalu Inc.,the nation's second-largest food wholesaler, said yesterday that it would take a $244 million charge in the third quarter, mainly to cover the costs of cutting back some of its operation. The company said it would sell as many as 30 stores and eliminate 4,300 jobs, or 10 percent of its work force, over the next two years. The company also said it would record a gain of $41 million in the quarter because of a favorable settlement with the Internal Revenue Service of a dispute relating to the company's 1992 taxes. These special items will lead to a net charge of $188 million, or $1.66 a share. In addition, the company said it would earn between 47 cents and 52 cents a share for the quarter that ends Dec. 3, less than the 62 cents a share that Wall Street analysts have been predicting.

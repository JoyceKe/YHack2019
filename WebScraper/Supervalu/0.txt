Wetterau's vice chairman, Laurence L. Anderson, has been in charge of its operations lately, said Lois Laverty, Ted Wetterau's executive assistant. She said she did not know if Mr. Anderson's title would change after the chairman retired.
Mr. Wetterau, who has been chairman of Wetterau Inc. since 1974 and chief executive since 1970, will join his two sons, Mark and Conrad, at Wetterau Associates, a holding company based in St. Louis. When Wetterau Inc. was acquired by Supervalu last year, Mr. Wetterau announced he intended to retire at the end of this year.
Supervalu became the nation's largest food wholesaler when it bought Wetterau Inc. for about $1.1 billion. Wetterau supplies food to stores in 29 states through eight distribution points from West Virginia to Maine.

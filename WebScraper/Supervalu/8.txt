Supervalu Inc., a food distributor in Minneapolis, said that it would sell its remaining 46 percent stake in Shopko Stores Inc., ending a 26-year investment in the discount retailer in a deal valued at about $270.3 million. Shopko, of Green Bay, Wis., agreed to buy back 8.17 million of its shares from Supervalu at $18.35 apiece. Then, Supervalu will sell its 6.56 million Shopko shares to the public if it can get at least $18.35 each. Shopko stock lost 25 cents a share, to $19.25; Supervalu also fell 25 cents, closing at $29.50. Supervalu, which began selling its Shopko shares in 1991, sought to sell its 46 percent stake in the planned merger of Shopko and Phar-Mor Inc., the drugstore chain. The deal fell through this month.

Albertson's and SuperValu said yesterday that their shareholders had approved a plan for Albertson's to be acquired by a consortium led by SuperValu, a move that will split up Albertson's operations and make SuperValu one of the biggest American grocers.
SuperValu, based in Minneapolis, is to buy most Albertson's grocery operations. The drugstore chain CVS will buy about 700 stand-alone Sav-On and Osco pharmacies and a distribution center, and a group including Cerberus Capital Management and the Kimco Realty Corporation will acquire some 655 underperforming grocery stores and a number of distribution centers.

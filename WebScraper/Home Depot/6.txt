With yet another round of court proceedings facing them, Home Depot officials are moving ahead with plans to build a super-size home and garden center in Port Chester. Paul D. Sirignano, the company's lawyer in Westchester, said the Atlanta-based retail giant is undeterred by a pending environmental approval process or other requirements by the village, in part because an earlier site plan had been upheld in the courts.
The Appellate Division of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn recently affirmed environmental reviews conducted by the village and agreed that the property had been zoned correctly. Mr. Sirignano also said the rulings upheld the dismissal of two appeals filed by the city of Rye and a neighborhood group, the Rye Citizens Committee.
The lawyer said the company had bought the land and had begun demolition for a $20 million, 101,400-square-foot home-improvement center and an 18,000-square-foot garden center on the Port Chester-Rye border.

Tyson Foods Inc. unexpectedly said yesterday that it was dismissing Saatchi & Saatchi Advertising in New York, effective today. Billings on the account, which the agency has handled for seven years, were estimated at $25 million to $30 million.
Jack Dunn, vice president for retail sales and marketing at Tyson in Springdale, Ark., said in a statement, "While our company has grown dramatically during the period of our relationship with Saatchi & Saatchi, after careful consideration our management has determined that it is simply time for a change."
Telephone calls last night to Mr. Dunn were not returned. Archie Schaffer, a spokesman for Tyson, which markets poultry and other food products under brands like Tyson, Weaver and Tyson Holly Farms, said he had no information about when a review would begin or which agencies might participate. He added, however, that he did not think the dismissal was related to the recent turmoil at the Saatchi & Saatchi Company, the agency's London-based parent.
Michael J. Jeary, the agency's chairman and chief executive, said yesterday: "We helped them achieve phenomenal growth and we're proud of that. But this might be the seven-year itch, which clients have the right to scratch."

Tyson Foods in Springdale, Ark., parted ways with the Chicago office of DDB Worldwide, part of the Omnicom Group, after nine years. Tyson cited a conflict with an account arriving at the DDB San Francisco office from a rival, ConAgra Foods.
The decision was made Friday, days after ConAgra named the DDB San Francisco office as the agency for its Banquet line. Those billings were estimated at $20 million. Tyson is shifting its account, with spending last year estimated at $45 million, to Arnold Worldwide, part of the Arnold Worldwide Partners unit of Havas, which Tyson hired in January to handle project work.

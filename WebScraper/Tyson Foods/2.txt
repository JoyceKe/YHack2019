Tyson Foods, a producer of meat products, posted a quarterly profit below analysts’ estimates on Monday and predicted a possible loss this quarter, setting off a decline of 10 percent in its share price.
“Given where leg-quarter prices are, breast meat prices are, we are going to lose some significant dollars” in the next quarter, Mr. Bond said during a conference call with analysts and investors. “It will be a negative quarter in chicken, and most likely a negative quarter over all for our results.”

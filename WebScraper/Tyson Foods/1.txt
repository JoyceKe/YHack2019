An attorney for Tyson Foods Inc. told the Delaware Chancery Court that directors of the Holly Farms Corporation had not pursued their stockholders' right to the best price. Tyson asserts that Holly Farm's board was influenced by Holly Farms' managers who are unfriendly to Tyson. Holly Farms, based in Memphis, has rejected two takeover offers from Tyson, which is the nation's top poultry producer. Holly Farm's board said last week that it would proceed with a proposed merger with Conagra Inc. Both deals are valued at about $1 billion.

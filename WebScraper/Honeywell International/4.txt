Honeywell International said it would sell a unit that distributes aerospace fasteners and hardware to B/E Aerospace for $1.05 billion, at least $800 million of which would be in cash and the rest in B/E stock. The business, called Consumable Solutions, generated revenues of $524 million last year, Honeywell said in a press release.

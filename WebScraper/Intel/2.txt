Analysts say Apple will develop a 5G iPhone by late next year. Those iPhones are expected to use chips from Qualcomm, another chip maker that, until recently, was in a legal fight with Apple over royalties and other business practices.
An iPhone capable of running on 5G networks, which offer speeds far faster than current wireless connections, could have big implications. A 5G iPhone could push the spread of such networks across the globe and encourage the adoption of new technologies that run on 5G, such as industrial robots, security cameras, drones and cars.
In April, Apple and Qualcomm settled a yearslong legal dispute. Although the companies are now on better terms, Apple has long sought to take more control over the critical parts inside of its devices.
For Intel, the transaction ends a long-running saga of missteps in mobile phone technology that began in the late 1990s. The company tried and failed initially to become a major supplier of chips that provide computing functions in phones, as it does in personal computers.
Then Intel shifted its focus to compete in so-called baseband modems, chips that manage cellular communications in phones. That effort began in earnest after it announced a deal in 2010 to purchase Infineon’s wireless chip business for $1.4 billion.
Intel never made money on baseband chips and showed little chance of doing so after Apple and Qualcomm settled their differences. Robert Swan, named Intel’s chief executive in January, announced plans to exit the business the same day.
Apple is acquiring Intel operations that employ 4,000 people in Munich, Germany; Linz, Austria; and San Diego, Calif. Intel said it was trying to retain or find external jobs for as many of those employees as possible.

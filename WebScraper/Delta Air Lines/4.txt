Passenger revenue in June for the Atlanta-based carrier exceeded $1 billion for the first time for a single month. Delta's percentage of seats filled with paying passengers -- also known as the load factor -- in both the quarter and the fiscal year exceeded its percentages in the comparable periods in 1992.
Delta cited success with cost reductions, led by the declining price of jet fuel. Delta's fuel expense in the quarter declined 1 percent from the previous year as consumption rose 1 percent but the cost per gallon decreased 2 percent, to 60.2 cents.

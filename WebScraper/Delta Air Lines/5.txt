Delta Air Lines reported a wider-than-expected loss of $133.9 million yesterday for its third quarter, which it attributed largely to a restructuring charge related to the grounding of 21 planes. Excluding the charge, Delta, the nation's third-largest airline, lost $81.7 million, which was more than analysts had expected.
Thomas J. Roeck Jr., the company's chief financial officer, said he was uncertain whether signs of industry improvements would be sustained. "It's hard to tell the difference between a blip and a sustained recovery," he said.

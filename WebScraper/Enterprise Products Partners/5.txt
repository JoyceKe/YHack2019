The El Paso Corporation, the natural gas pipeline owner, would get an additional $370 million for the sale of its investment in GulfTerra Energy Partners under a new agreement with the buyer, Enterprise Products Partners. El Paso, which is based in Houston, agreed to accept a 9.9 percent stake in the general partner that manages the combined company, rather than the 50 percent stake announced in December, El Paso said. El Paso's cash proceeds from the sale would rise to $1.35 billion under the new agreement. Enterprise Products, also based in Houston, agreed on Dec. 15 to buy GulfTerra for $3.23 billion in cash and units and assume $1.7 billion in debt.

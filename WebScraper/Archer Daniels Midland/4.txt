Archer Daniels Midland, the largest producer of ethanol in the country, is signing supply contracts with East Coast gasoline refiners that are anticipating that a ban on methyl tertiary butyl ether, or M.T.B.E., in New York and Connecticut will come into force at the end of the year. Gasoline refiners use ethanol to stretch supplies and cut emissions by raising the fuel's oxygen levels. About 75 percent of California's gasoline is currently being blended with ethanol as refiners in the state adjust to a similar M.T.B.E. ban. The additive was found to leak from storage tanks and foul drinking water supplies.

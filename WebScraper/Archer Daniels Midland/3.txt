The Archer-Daniels-Midland Company said yesterday that earnings jumped 50.7 percent in its fiscal second quarter as a combination of falling American farm prices and rising overseas demand for food products pushed up profit margins.
The company, a food processor based in Decatur, Ill., said its net income rose to $220.1 million, or 43 cents a share, from $146.1 million, or 28 cents, in the period a year earlier. Per-share figures reflect a 5 percent stock dividend in September and a 3-for-2 split in December.
The average price of processed soybean oil, which the company makes, rose 6.3 percent, to 29.9 cents a pound in the latest quarter, while the average price for soybeans fell 15 percent, to $5.55 a bushel.

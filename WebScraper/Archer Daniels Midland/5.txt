The Archer Daniels Midland Company said yesterday that it had agreed to buy 45 percent of United Grain Growers in a series of transactions totaling $82 million. Archer Daniels, based in Decatur, Ill., said its strategic alliance would give United Grain Growers, based in Winnipeg, Manitoba, access to world markets. In March, United Grain Growers fought off a hostile takeover bid by the Alberta Wheat Pool and Manitoba Pool Elevators.

A class action lawsuit has been filed against the insurer for the A.H. Robins Company, maker of the Dalkon Shield intrauterine device that was taken off the market in 1974 because of injuries suffered by women who used it. The suit, filed Thursday in Federal District Court in St. Paul, is the first against the Aetna Casualty and Surety Company in connection with the Dalkon Shield. Robins filed for bankruptcy protection last year, and the approximately 250,000 women who claim injuries from the Dalkon Shield will be paid along with other creditors.

Chubb is Chubb, Apple is Apple and MCI is MCI. But not all over-the- counter stocks are as easily recognized by their published O-T-C listings. A holder of, say, Comprehensive Care stock might find it hard to tell at a glance whether he should look under CompC, Compcp, CmpA or a host of other alphabetical flourishes.
The listing below is intended as a guide through the thickets of the O-T-C. It includes top-ranked companies whose stocks are among the 739 securities included in the Nasdaq National Market System - the ones found in The New York Times under the ''National Market'' heading.
In all, there are some 4,500 Nasdaq securities - the National Market plus about 1,790 on the National List, which has less stringent requirements, and some 2,000 on the Supplemental List. The Times publishes trading data on the complete National Market and National List, provided by The Associated Press, and also publishes data on the top- ranked quarter of the Supplemental List.
To qualify for Nasdaq's National Market System - a system mandated by Congress in 1975 and operated by the National Association of Securities Dealers - companies must meet certain requirements in addition to those required for the National List. If an issue has traded an average of 600,000 shares a month for six months and sells for $10 or more, then under Securities and Exchange Commission rules it must be placed in the National Market System. If the issue has traded at an average of 100,000 shares a month for six months and sells for $5 or more, the company may elect to join the National Market voluntarily.

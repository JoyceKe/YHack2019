Dow Chemical's chairman and chief executive, Frank P. Popoff, who succeeded Paul F. Oreffice last week, on Friday named William S. Stavropoulos president and chief operating officer, effective April 1. Dow Chemical has been without a chief operating officer since the late 1980's, a company spokesman, Matt Davis, said.
Under the new management structure, Mr. Popoff, 57 years old, will be responsible for all Dow functions, Dow Elanco, Dow Brands, Marion Merrell Dow and the executive committee. He was previously the company's president.

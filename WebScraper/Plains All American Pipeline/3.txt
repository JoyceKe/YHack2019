The El Paso Energy Corporation, a fast-growing natural gas company based in Houston, agreed yesterday to buy part of an oil pipeline in the Southwest from Plains All American Pipeline L.P. for $129 million. Under the agreement, El Paso's El Paso Natural Gas Company is to acquire a 1,088-mile portion that runs from McCamey, Tex., to near Bakersfield, Calif. El Paso is to spend $75 million to convert the oil pipeline to a natural gas pipeline. The project would enable El Paso to replace its existing natural gas compression operations, reducing costs. Plains All American Pipeline, an oil transportation and storage partnership, is controlled by Plains Resources Inc. of Houston.

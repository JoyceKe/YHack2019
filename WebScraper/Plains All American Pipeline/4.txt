Plains Resources Inc. agreed yesterday to buy the oil pipeline unit of the Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company and two other Goodyear businesses for $420 million in cash. Plains said it would buy Goodyear's All American Pipeline System, which connects oilfields in California with West Texas, as well as the Celeron Gathering Corporation and the Celeron Trading and Transportation Company. The deal ends Goodyear's diversification attempt. Goodyear, the big North American tire maker, spent $1.6 billion building All American in 1983 and will report a $35 million loss on the sale. Shares of the Houston-based Plains rose $2.125 yesterday, to $17.8125. Goodyear fell 93.75 cents, to $73.5625.

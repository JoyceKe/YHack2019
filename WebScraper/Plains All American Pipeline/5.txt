Plains All-American Pipeline, a large energy company, is taking its unsolicited offer to buy a rival, SemGroup, for $1 billion in cash directly to SemGroup’s shareholders, the company announced in a letter to the company made public on Monday.
The bid of $24 a share for SemGroup, which was made on Oct. 6 and rejected by the company’s board shortly thereafter, is the second time Plains has tried to buy SemGroup, which is based in Oklahoma. In March 2010, Plains made an unsuccessful bid of $17 a share. Its latest proposal valued SemGroup at an enterprise value of $1.24 billion.
“We are disappointed that SemGroup’s board of directors has refused to engage in constructive discussions with us regarding a possible transaction,” Greg L. Armstrong, the chief executive of Plains, said in a statement. “We believe that the attractive and certain value we are proposing to deliver to SemGroup’s stockholders is greater than any value that might be created on a reasonable timetable from any of SemGroup’s other strategic alternatives.”
The repeated attempts by Plains to buy SemGroup, which has been revamping its operations after emerging from bankruptcy in 2009, are “anything but opportunistic,” Plains said in its letter. It also said that SemGroup’s pipelines and storage facilities would create “significant value for synergies” when combined with assets held by Plains.
“We continue to believe, and SemGroup’s recent performance appears to confirm, that on a stand-alone basis SemGroup will continue to fall materially short of expectations, including the plan of reorganization forecasts,” Mr. Armstrong said in the letter. “Your refusal to engage with us will only further delay the ability of your stockholders to realize liquidity and receive the substantial value represented by our all-cash proposal.”
“In its Oct. 19, 2011 response to Plains All American’s Oct. 6, 2011 unsolicited proposal, SemGroup noted that its board and management team are enthusiastic about the company’s prospects and are confident of achieving stockholder returns in excess of what can be derived from Plains All American’s unsolicited proposal,” SemGroup said in its statement.

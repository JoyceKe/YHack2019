The Marathon Oil Company said a delineation well off the coast of Indonesia had flowed at a cumulative rate of 11,242 barrels of oil and 6.3 million cubic feet of natural gas a day during tests. Marathon said its Marathon Petroleum Indonesia unit had completed the well about three-quarters of a mile northwest of its successful KH-1X discovery well on the Kakap block. The well was drilled to a total depth of 7,175 feet, Marathon said.

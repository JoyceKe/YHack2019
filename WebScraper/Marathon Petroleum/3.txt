Updated, 9:03 a.m. | The Hess Corporation said on Thursday that it would sell its retail arm, including its familiar green-and-white gas stations, to Marathon Petroleum for $2.6 billion as it focuses on exploring and drilling for oil.
“The sale of our retail business marks the culmination of our strategic transformation into a pure-play exploration and production company,” John B. Hess, the company’s chief executive, said in a statement. “I especially want to express my deepest appreciation to our employees in the retail business for their outstanding work and extraordinary dedication over the years building the Hess brand and serving our loyal customers.”
Meanwhile, Marathon Petroleum will buy the biggest operator of convenience stores on the East Coast, an operation with 1,256 stores in 16 states. The company’s Speedway subsidiary is slightly bigger, with 1,480 stores in nine states.
“This acquisition will be transformative for MPC and Speedway as it will significantly expand our retail presence from nine to 23 states through these premier Hess locations throughout the East Coast and Southeast,” Gary R. Heminger, Marathon Petroleum’s chief executive, said in a statement.

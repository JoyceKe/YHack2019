The Procter & Gamble Company, which reported in April its first decline in quarterly profit in nine years, said today that it would raise its cash dividend by 9.4 percent, about one-fourth less than its average annual increase since 1995. The company said the quarterly dividend on its common stock would increase to 35 cents from 32 cents, payable Aug. 15 to shareholders of record on July 21. Procter & Gamble has raised its dividend an average of 13 percent a year for the last five years.

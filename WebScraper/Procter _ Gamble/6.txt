David S. Taylor, the group president for global health and grooming, will take over the company’s global beauty unit, effectively giving him control of businesses that generate more than 40 percent of the company’s revenue.
“These leadership changes are another step forward in improving strategies, capabilities and plans on key business priorities where P.&G. needs to win,” Paul Fox, the company’s director of corporate communications, said in an email. “It will continue to make us a simpler, more focused company that is faster growing and creating greater value for consumers and shareholders.”
Mr. Taylor and Ms. Henretta are among a small pool of contenders to succeed A.G. Lafley, Procter & Gamble’s 67-year-old chief executive. The changes suggest that Ms. Henretta may no longer be under consideration.
“It probably takes her out of the running for being C.E.O.,” said Ali Dibadj, an analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein & Company. Mr. Dibadj said he thought Mr. Taylor’s expanded role was “another step” toward the chief executive’s office.
In his new position, Mr. Taylor, 56, will oversee the largest percentage of the company’s business. He will also be charged with turning around its struggling beauty unit, which has suffered from flat sales growth and has lost market share to competitors like L’Oréal and Unilever.
Procter & Gamble, which built an empire out of Tide detergent and other household products, is in the midst of an ambitious corporate restructuring. The company announced plans in August to divest up to 100 brands in an effort to focus on a core group of 70 to 80 brands.

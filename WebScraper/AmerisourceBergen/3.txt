They said the combined company would be the second-largest institutional pharmacy, with annual revenue of $1.9 billion and earnings before interest and taxes of $75 million. The companies expect about $30 million in cost savings from the deal.
Kindred, based in Louisville, Ky., is contributing its Kindred Pharmacy Services segment and AmerisourceBergen, based in Chesterbrook, Pa., is contributing its PharMerica Long-Term Care business. The segments provide drugs to hospitals, nursing homes and other health-care facilities. Amerisource’s Pharmerica segment also has a workers’ compensation business that will not be included in the deal, Amerisource said.

The AmerisourceBergen Corporation said yesterday that it had agreed to buy AutoMed Technologies, a maker of automated pharmacy dispensing equipment, for about $120 million in cash. AmerisourceBergen, a pharmaceutical services company based in Chesterbrook, Pa., said the agreement included incentive payments based on AutoMed's achieving earnings goals over the next two and a half years. AutoMed, privately held and based in Chicago, expects revenue of more than $60 million in 2002. AmerisourceBergen reported sales of $22 billion for its six months ended March 31.

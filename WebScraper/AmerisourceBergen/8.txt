“MWI is the premier supply chain company in animal health, with leading positions in both the companion and production markets, and we are very excited to have them join AmerisourceBergen,” Steven H. Collis, AmerisourceBergen’s chief executive, said in a statement. “Animal health is a growing market in the U.S. and internationally and is a logical extension of our pharmaceutical distribution and services businesses.
AmerisourceBergen, which is based in Valley Forge, Pa., said the deal for MWI, which is based in Boise, Idaho, would add about 8 cents a share to earnings for the 2015 fiscal year and generate $50 million in synergies by the end of the third full year.

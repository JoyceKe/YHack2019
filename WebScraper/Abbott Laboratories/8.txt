Abbott Laboratories said today that its second-quarter profit rose 6.2 percent as higher sales of some drugs made up for generic competition for another medicine and suspension of sales of some medical tests.
Net income rose to $685 million, or 44 cents a share, compared with $645 million, or 41 cents a share, in the quarter a year earlier. Sales rose 3.4 percent, to $3.37 billion from $3.26 billion. The results matched analysts' estimates, according to First Call/Thomson Financial.
Sales of the ulcer drug Prevacid and some drugs used in anesthesia compensated for declining sales of Abbott's drug for enlarged prostates, Hytrin, which faces generic competition in the United States. Abbott is working to bring medical-test manufacturing in line with Food and Drug Administration regulations after it paid a record $100 million F.D.A. fine for violations last year.
Abbott gained from rising sales of Prevacid through TAP Pharmaceuticals, its venture with Takeda Chemical Industries of Japan. Sales in that unit rose 21 percent, to $839 million. Hospital-product sales rose 17 percent, to $659 million, as Abbott sold more drugs used for anesthesia.
In 1999, the F.D.A. fined Abbott for failing to comply with manufacturing standards for medical tests. Abbott agreed to suspend sales of some tests until it met F.D.A. standards. The banned test kits represented $250 million a year in sales, about 8 percent of Abbott's $3-billion-a-year diagnostics business.

Abbott Laboratories said it would cut about 400 jobs and close an office in Bedford, Mass., to prepare for its planned purchase of TheraSense. Operations at Abbott's MediSense unit in Bedford will be combined with the diabetes business of TheraSense, an Abbott spokeswoman, Melissa Brotz, said. The employees who lose their jobs will be offered severance or retirement packages. About 100 people will be offered other employment within the company. Shareholders of TheraSense, which is based in Alameda, Calif., will vote on the acquisition next month. Abbott is based in Abbott Park, Ill.

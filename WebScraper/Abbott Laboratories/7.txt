Abbott Laboratories said yesterday that it had agreed to acquire a closely held French maker of bench-top clinical chemistry laboratory analyzers. The drug and medical supply maker said it would acquire Alcyon Analyzer S.A., a company with 1996 revenues of less than $50 million. Alcyon makes a family of three low-volume automated diagnostic test instruments. Abbott stock rose 25 cents, to $54.50.

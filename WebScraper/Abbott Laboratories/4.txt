Abbott Laboratories said it won Food and Drug Administration approval to keep selling its drug Synthroid, taken by about eight million people in the United States for thyroid disorders. Synthroid has been on the market for more than 40 years, Abbott said. The F.D.A. asked in 1997 that companies submit new applications for Synthroid and rival medicines because they were introduced before the agency established drug regulations. Abbott filed the application after acquiring Synthroid with its $6.9 billion purchase of Knoll in 2001.

Johnson Controls Inc., a maker of automotive interiors, said it would buy a German automotive-electronics maker, Borg Instruments, to improve its European-built products. The acquisition will add to fiscal 2004 earnings, Johnson Controls said. It did not disclose the terms of the cash purchase. Borg, based in Remchingen, Germany, has 400 workers and had sales last year of 55 million euros ($64 million). Johnson Controls is based in Milwaukee.

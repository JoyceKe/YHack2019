Ingram Micro Inc. said yesterday that it was buying Intelligent Electronics Inc.'s computer distribution business for $78 million in cash and assumed debt. Ingram, based in Santa Ana, Calif., is the world's largest distributor of personal computers and accessories, with $12 billion in revenue last year and operations in 19 countries. The acquisition will add $3 billion in annual sales, analysts said. Intelligent Electronics, based in Exton, Pa., said the sale of its Reseller Network Division would allow it to focus on its business of selling directly to computer equipment users. Ingram's shares were unchanged at $22.75; Intelligent Electronics' shares rose 31.25 cents, to $3.

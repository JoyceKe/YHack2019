UnitedHealth Group, the health-insurance giant, said on Monday it would acquire Sierra Health Services for $2.6 billion, or $43.50 in cash per share, to help it expand in the fast-growing Southwest. Sierra provides health benefits and services to 310,000 members in Nevada and 320,000 customers throughout the United States.
“Combining UnitedHealthcare and Sierra brings together two strong and innovative companies that each have a heritage of providing consumers access to affordable, quality medical care,” Stephen J. Hemsley, UnitedHealth’s president and chief executive, said in a statement.

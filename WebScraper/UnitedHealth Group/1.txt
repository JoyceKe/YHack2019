UnitedHealth Group, the nation's second-largest health insurer behind WellPoint, said yesterday that its fourth-quarter earnings increased 46 percent after it added members through acquisitions. Profit this year will rise more than forecast, the company said.
The company, which is based in Minnetonka, Minn., relied on acquisitions rather than job growth to increase membership by 3.38 million last year, sending quarterly revenue past the $10 billion mark for the first time.
"The best way to grow membership in a slower economy is by acquisitions, and they've done that," said Michael Obuchowski, a money manager at Altanes Investments in New York, which owns UnitedHealth shares.
The UnitedHealth divisions that focus on providing health care services for state Medicaid programs and Americans over the age of 50 had combined revenue of $9.32 billion, an increase of 44 percent from the year earlier.
Revenue from the company's Ingenix business, which provides software that large employers can use to track changes in spending across their entire range of employee benefits programs, rose 20 percent to $214 million.

Deere & Company said that because of lessened production requirements for large tractors and combines, it would reduce its salaried work force in East Moline, Ill., and Waterloo, Iowa, by 600. The reductions, which amount to 5 percent of Deere's salaried employees in North America, would be achieved through ''special early retirements, layoffs and voluntary and involuntary separations,'' said the farm equipment manufacturer, which is based in Moline, Ill.

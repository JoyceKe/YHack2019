Deere & Company, in an effort to diversify its farm implement business, has signed a multimillion-dollar deal to develop a rotary engine for the Marine Corps. A Deere subsidiary signed the three-year, $33.5 million contract for research and development of an engine for use in amphibious assault vehicles. The project involves Deere's 750-horsepower, 5.8-liter twin-rotor engine.

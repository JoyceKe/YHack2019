CPC International Inc., a food concern, said the McKesson Corporation had agreed to settle a suit brought by CPC in 1985 involving CPC's purchase of the C.F. Mueller Company from McKesson. CPC did not disclose the terms of the settlement but said the proceeds amounted mostly to a reduction in the purchase price of Mueller, a manufacturer of pasta products, and would not have a material effect on earnings. McKesson, a drugstore operator based in San Francisco, said the settlement would result in earnings reductions of 10 cents a share for the year ending March 31.

The company, based in San Jose, California, reported net income of $2.2 billion, or 37 cents a share, for the period, flat from the year-early quarter, when net income was $2.21 billion, or 35 cents a share.. Excluding charges, Cisco earned 42 cents a share, beating the 39 cents a share Wall Street analysts polled by Thomson Reuters had predicted.
While Cisco faces similar challenges to other technology companies because of the weaker economy, its diverse business and dominant position in the networking market should help it hold up better than most, analysts said. The company continues to record large government purchases, and it benefits from a number of continuing service renewal contracts, Mark Sue, an analyst with RBC Capital Markets, said in a recent research note.

HCA, the giant hospital operator that was acquired by buyout firms in 2006, is seeking to price its initial public offering at as much as $30 a share when it begins its presentation to investors next week, people briefed on the matter told DealBook on Friday.
Buyout firms have sought to take many of their portfolio companies public again to seize upon improving stock markets. Several of these companies, many acquired during the buyout boom of 2006 and 2007, have exceeded expectations upon their return to public markets, including Nielsen Holdings and Kinder Morgan.
I.P.O.’s can generate returns for private equity firms’ investors, an important consideration as these firms go hat in hand to raise new funds. Their proceeds can also go toward paying down the sometimes huge debt loads that portfolio companies acquired as part of their takeovers.
HCA was acquired in 2006 by a group led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Bain Capital and Merrill Lynch‘s private equity arm. The company is a giant among American for-profit hospital operators, running 162 hospitals and 104 more surgery centers in the United States and Britain.
The company’s I.P.O. is being led by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Citigroup and JPMorgan Chase, with Barclays Capital, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley and Wells Fargo also participating.

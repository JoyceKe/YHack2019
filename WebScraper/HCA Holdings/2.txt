On Wednesday evening, the initial public offering for HCA was priced at $30 a share — at the high end of its expected range — and the stock opened on Thursday at $31.20. The shares rose as high as $31.50 before closing at $31.02, up 3.4 percent on the day.
It underscores that the market for initial offerings has revived after some turmoil and uncertainty last year. The dollar volume for I.P.O.’s in the United States is $12.5 billion this year, the strongest annual start since 2000, according to Thomson Reuters data. The market is six times busier than it was at this time last year, Thomson Reuters said.
HCA was one of the biggest and best-known of the large buyouts during the last private equity boom. Bain Capital, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Merrill Lynch Global Private Equity and HCA’s co-founding Frist family took the company private for $32.7 billion in 2006.

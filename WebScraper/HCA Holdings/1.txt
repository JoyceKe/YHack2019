The company, which is expected to be among the biggest buyout-backed debuts in years, could raise as much as $4.2 billion in the offering, according to a regulatory filing on Tuesday. That’s down modestly from previous expectations of $4.6 billion.
After a tepid turnout in 2010, there has been a modest uptick in buyout-backed offerings this year, with several exceeding expectations. Among the recent I.P.O.’s are Nielsen Holdings, Kinder Morgan and Bank United. HCA is currently pitching its offering to investors.
A private equity consortium, including Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Bain Capital and Merrill Lynch, acquired HCA in 2006, loading the company up with debt. HCA, in its filing, said it planned to use proceeds from its offering to pay off some of its debt.

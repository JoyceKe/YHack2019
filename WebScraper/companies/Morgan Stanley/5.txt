NEW YORK â€” Morgan Stanley, a leading investment bank, agreed to a record $19 million settlement with the New York Stock Exchange covering the company's lapses in issuing prospectuses as well as two separate cases of employee embezzlement and fraud that totaled $61.4 million, the exchange said Wednesday.
The embezzlement cases, for which Morgan Stanley was fined $6 million under the settlement, involved a branch office representative in San Juan, Puerto Rico, who bilked investors out of $56 million from 1991 to 2004, and an unidentified fixed-income manager in New York who diverted $5.4 million to his own accounts from 1998 to 2002.
The rest of the settlement came from Morgan Stanley's failure to send prospectuses to investors considering the purchase of new stock issues, a violation of both U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission and stock exchange regulations. Other, smaller regulatory lapses were also involved in the settlement, which was completed last week, an exchange spokesman said.In addition to the fines, the exchange also censured the firm.
The exchange said that it had discovered "numerous supervisory, operational and technological deficiencies" in some of Morgan Stanley's operations.Morgan Stanley settled the cases without admitting guilt, the exchange said. Andrea Slattery, a spokeswoman for the company, had no comment on the settlement.
The prospectus case had prompted the exchange to ask 25 Wall Street chief executives if their firms had similar problems. At least one other top firm came forward, the exchange regulators said, and a number of cases are pending.

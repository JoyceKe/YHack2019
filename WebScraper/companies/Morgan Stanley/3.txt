The investment bank Morgan Stanley has long been famous for stonewalling in the face of requests to produce documents, but when it tried these tactics in its bruising legal battle with Ronald Perelman, the billionaire financier, it won only grief. The bank has been ordered to pay $1.45 billion in actual and punitive damages to Mr. Perelman, thanks mostly to its persistent and misguided resistance.
Mr. Perelman had sued Morgan Stanley, accusing it of helping to falsely inflate the deteriorating finances of the Sunbeam Corporation to induce him to accept that company's stock as partial payment in a buyout transaction. Although the average onlooker may find it hard to believe that Mr. Perelman was all that easy to dupe, he did not even have to prove his case. In midstream, the judge, angry that Morgan Stanley had repeatedly evaded orders to turn over e-mail messages, ruled that under Florida law, the jurors could take it for granted that the bank and Sunbeam had conspired to commit fraud. The burden of proof shifted to Morgan Stanley to prove otherwise, a hurdle it could not overcome.
The bank will appeal the verdict, and many analysts expect the two sides to settle. The debacle is already roiling the legal ranks at Morgan Stanley, which brought in a new lawyer to rule over the chief counsel deemed responsible for the intransigent tactics and fired its chief outside law firm -- all because someone didn't think it necessary to satisfy disclosure orders from the court.

Honeywell, based in Morris Township, N.J., offered 275 pence a share for First Technology, 35 percent more than the closing price on Dec. 9, the last trading day before the British company said it had received a takeover offer. Honeywell will also assume Â£107 million (about $190 million) in debt.
Buying First Technology adds portable tools to Honeywell's range of gas-detection products. First Technology also supplies crash-test dummies to customers like Ford Motor and General Motors. The transaction should close in the first half of next year, Honeywell said.

Mr. Verrant, 51, succeeds John Fallon, who left on April 1 for a similar position at the Rockwell International Corporation. Mr. Verrant will be a senior vice president of Allied-Signal, as well as the president of its overseas operation.
Mr. Verrant is currently the group executive for military aviation systems at Honeywell and is a 27-year Honeywell employee with extensive experience abroad. At Allied-Signal, he will report to Edward L. Hennessy Jr., the chairman and chief executive.
''I'm very excited about Ed Hennessy's interest in expanding more into the global marketplace,'' Mr. Verrant said yesterday, adding that the company was interested in how European economic unity, scheduled for late 1992, would affect its business there. ''We want to make sure we have the position we want as we move toward the consolidation of that market,'' he said.
Allied-Signal, based in Morris Township, N.J., does a big automotive business abroad and plans to expand in aerospace and engineered materials. About 30 percent of the company's 110,000 employees work outside the United States in 46 nations and territories.
Mr. Verrant grew up in Minnesota and received his undergradaute degree and a master's degree in physics from the University of Minnesota. He went directly to work for Honeywell as a systems engineer and spent 10 years in engineering-related jobs before transferring to Washington, to Honeywell's office involved in selling computers to the Federal Government.

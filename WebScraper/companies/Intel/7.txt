The Intel Corporation, a major producer of semiconductor memory circuits, reported yesterday that net income for the fourth quarter of 1980 slipped four-tenths of 1 percent, to $22.9 million, or 52 cents a share, from $23 million, or 54 cents a share, in the fourth quarter of 1979. Revenues rose 12.5 percent, to $219.2 million, from $194.8 million.
For the full year, the Santa Clara, Calif., company said, net income increased 24.3 percent, to $96.7 million, or $2.21 a share, from $77.8 million, or $1.85 a share. Sales widened by 29.3 percent, to $854.6 million, from $661 million.
Gordon E. Moore, Intel's chairman and chief executive, said that although unit demand had continued to grow the company experienced rapid price declines for a number of its products because of major capacity expansions and a sluggish economy.

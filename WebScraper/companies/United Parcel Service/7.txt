The United Parcel Service informed shippers yesterday that its nationwide contract with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters would expire at 12;01 A.M. today and that customers should be prepared for the possibility of a strike Wednesday.
A spokesman for U.P.S., Dan Buckley, said that if a strike occurred, ''package pickup and delivery operations would cease in all 50 states, involving the movement of more than 6 million parcels daily.''
Mr. Buckley said that the company ''is advising its customers that pickup service will continue at least through Tuesday'' but that it was also suggesting that customers limit pickups to packages intended for local delivery.

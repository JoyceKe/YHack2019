United Parcel Service Inc., the package delivery company, said yesterday that it was warning managers that job cuts were likely as it moved to lower costs and reduce overlapping operations. The number of jobs to be eliminated has not been determined, the company said. "We are sending communications to U.P.S. management people today stating that we now believe some reductions in management staff will be necessary," the company said in a statement. The Wall Street Journal, quoting senior executives, reported yesterday that U.P.S., based in Atlanta, would cut more than 2,000 management positions. About 35,000 of its 300,000 workers are managers.

United Parcel Service of America Inc. said yesterday that it planned to acquire Sonicair in a move intended to help U.P.S. provide same-day delivery service later this year. Sonicair is a privately held company based in Scottsdale, Ariz., that provides delivery services and operates warehouses. The company will continue to operate independently as a wholly owned unit of U.P.S. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. U.P.S., based in Atlanta, said the purchase could also help the company provide manufacturers with same-day inventory-replacement services.

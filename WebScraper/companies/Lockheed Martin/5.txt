Lockheed Martin's Manned Space Systems, which builds the external fuel tank for the space shuttle, said today that it would cut up to 200 jobs in New Orleans this year. The reductions are the result of a shrinking NASA budget and the movement of a lighter-weight external tank from development to production, the company said. As of Jan. 1, 2,565 workers were employed at Lockheed Martin's plant in New Orleans.

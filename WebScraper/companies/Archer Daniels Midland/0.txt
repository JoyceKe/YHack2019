For someone long used to having his way in the complex worlds of business and politics, last week was a shocker for Dwayne O. Andreas, the chairman of the Archer Daniels Midland Company. After more than a year of combating a Government investigation into allegations of price-fixing of agricultural products, Archer Daniels finally folded its cards. It agreed to plead guilty to the crime and pay a $100 million fine -- more than seven times the highest amount ever paid in such a case.
But behind this is a family tragedy. After decades in which the company was run as a virtual Andreas family fief, it has been forced to turn on its own. As part of the agreement, Archer Daniels executives -- from Mr. Andreas on down -- must now cooperate in the continuing investigation of two longtime company officials, including the chairman's own son, Michael D. Andreas. After a recommendation from some of the company's directors, the younger Mr. Andreas, the vice chairman and once the heir apparent, stepped down. He is expected to fight any charges. But his battle will be tough. Family and friends may be called to testify. Three competitors who fixed prices have offered evidence against him. And a former ally secretly taped the whole conspiracy for the Government.

The Archer Daniels Midland Company, one of the world's largest processors of oilseed, corn and wheat, said yesterday that it would permanently close its cottonseed plants in Montgomery, Ala., and North Little Rock, Ark., because of poor market conditions in the cottonseed business. Archer Daniels said it would also indefinitely close its cottonseed processing operations at Levelland and Sweetwater, Tex. The company, based in Decatur, Ill., did not say how many employees would be affected by the moves.

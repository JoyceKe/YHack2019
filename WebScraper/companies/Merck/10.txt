Jurors in New Orleans deliberated for two hours before rejecting claims by Charles Mason, 64, who blamed Vioxx for his heart attack in 2003. He also claimed that Merck had failed to warn of the drug's risks.
The victory helps Merck in its fight against more than 23,000 lawsuits over Vioxx, which the company withdrew in 2004 when a study showed it raised the risk of heart attacks. Merck has won six cases and lost four. A seventh company victory was overturned.
"The more they are able to win individual cases in the early days, the more they can be in a position to essentially bludgeon individual plaintiff lawyers," said David A. Logan, dean of the Roger Williams University School of Law in Rhode Island.

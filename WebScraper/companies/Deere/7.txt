Deere & Company, the world's largest maker of tractors and combines, said this week that it had formed a joint venture with the Tianjin Tractor Manufacturing Company to improve sales by expanding geographically. Deere will own 51 percent of the John Deere Tiantuo Company, which will make and sell four models of tractors in China. The companies jointly invested about $21 million in the venture, which is based 100 miles southeast of Beijing in Tianjin, China.

Deere & Company, the farm equipment maker, plans to establish a European Technology and Innovation Center in Kaiserslautern, Germany, to meet demands of customers in the region. The location will have as many as 200 engineers, who will develop improvements for Deereâ€™s machinery to improve agricultural productivity. The site is scheduled to open in early 2010, Deere said. The company, based in Moline, Ill., did not disclose the cost of the project.

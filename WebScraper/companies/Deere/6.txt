Deere's earnings of $110.2 million in the latest quarter excluded a one-time restructuring charge of $80 million. Per-share earnings of $1.44 were significantly above analysts' expectations of 86 cents per share.
Analysts shared that optimism. Steven Colbert at Prudential Securities Research, San Francisco, said he is raising his 1993 earnings estimate for Deere to $3 a share from $1.80 a share. His revised estimate excludes the impact of the $80 million charge Deere took in the latest quarter to revamp its European operations.
Net sales to dealers worldwide of Deere agricultural, industrial and lawn and garden equipment rose 15 percent in the second quarter and 8 percent for the first six months of the year, said the company, which is based in Moline, Ill.

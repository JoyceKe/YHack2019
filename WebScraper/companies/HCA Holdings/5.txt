HCA, the big hospital operator acquired by private equity firms in 2006, priced its initial public offering at $30 a share on Wednesday evening, raising $3.78 billion, people briefed on the matter said.
It follows in the footsteps of companies like Nielsen Holdings and Kinder Morgan, whose initial offerings received warm welcomes from investors this year. Shares in Nielsen, the media ratings company, remain nearly 8 percent above their debut price.
HCA was acquired in 2006 by a group led by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, Bain Capital and Merrill Lynch’s private equity arm, as well as members of its founding Frist family. The company is a giant among American profit-making hospital operators, running 162 hospitals and 104 surgery centers in the United States and Britain.
It is widely regarded as one of the more successful leveraged buyouts of the credit boom. Its business has improved in the nearly five years since it was acquired, reporting $30.7 billion in revenue and $1.2 billion in earnings attributable to its current owners.
HCA’s private equity owners stand to make more than three times their original equity investments, benefiting from rising earnings at the company — and having taken out roughly $4.25 billion through dividend payments.

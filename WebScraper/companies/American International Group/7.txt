The American International Group Inc., the country's most profitable insurance company, reported strong gains in all its major businesses yesterday as profits in the second quarter rose 14.4 percent, to $549.7 million, or $1.74 a share. Wall Street had been expecting about $1.64 a share.
In the property-insurance business, where intense competition for commercial accounts has led to price cutting that has caused many other companies to pay more in claims than they collect in premiums, American International continued to collect more in premiums than it paid in claims. Pretax profits for property insurance totaled $379.2 million, up 14.1 percent from the comparable period a year earlier.
The company's domestic and overseas life-insurance business was also strong, with pretax profits totaling $213.3 million before capital gains, up 18.7 percent from a year ago. Growth was particularly strong in Asia, the company said, adding that it had formed new businesses in several Latin American countries and Pakistan.

The American International Group said yesterday that the Securities and Exchange Commission planned to sue the company for helping the PNC Financial Services Group remove bad loans from its books. AIG Financial Products, a unit of American International, sold partnerships that regulators said PNC improperly used for the loans. PNC, based in Pittsburgh, agreed last year to pay $115 million to settle Justice Department allegations that it used the entities to inflate 2001 earnings by 52 percent by removing $762 million in bad loans from financial statements. American International, based in New York, said the S.E.C. suit would be unwarranted.

Profits increased in all of the company's major lines of business, with gains of more than 20 percent in both life insurance and property and casualty insurance business. There were also gains in its airplane leasing and other financial businesses.
Premiums from the life insurance business, where American International is expanding rapidly in Asia, rose 22 percent. In the property and casualty business, the company's performance was "the best underwriting result in memory," Michael Frinquelli, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, said. The total cost of claims and expenses amounted to 96.4 percent of premiums.
American International's net income totaled $633.8 million, or $2.01 a share, compared with $549.7 million, or $1.74 share, in the corresponding 1994 quarter. Revenues rose 15 percent, to $6.46 billion.
Wall Street had been expecting the company to earn about $1.88 a share in the latest period. As a result, its stock quickly jumped $3.625 in early trading after the financial results were released. It later closed at $111.50, up 50 cents on the day.

American International Group reported yesterday that its third-quarter net income rose 33 percent from a year earlier. The worldwide insurer and financial services company earned $451 million, compared with $339 million in the quarter the previous year.
During the last two years the company, like other insurers, has had large losses as a result of unusually big catastrophes, including floods in the Midwest, a typhoon in Japan and an earthquake in Guam. But Maurice R. Greenberg, the company's chairman, said that excluding those large losses, pretax operating income was up 13.5 percent from the third quarter last year.

While the company gave up the gains by the close of the market, the stock benefited from “Buy”-equivalent ratings from Lehman Brothers and Stifel Nicolaus analysts. The stock gained as much as $2.89, or 5.7 percent, to hit $53.95 yesterday, but ended the day down 48 cents at $50.58.
Lehman analyst Michael Branca placed the shares on his Favorites list in the beverage and tobacco sector and set a price target of $59 per share. He said the stock will benefit from being separated from Altria’s slowing U.S. sales and the threat of lawsuits.
Investors have long anticipated the Philip Morris International spinoff as a way to get a pure play on the growing overseas tobacco business without being tied to a shrinking U.S. cigarette market. The company trails only state-run China National Tobacco in terms of global market share.

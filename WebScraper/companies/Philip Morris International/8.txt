''We understand that the commission has issued a statement of objections, but we have not yet sighted the document,'' said Andrew Whist, vice president of public relations at Philip Morris. ''We have been advised that our investment in Rothmans International is consistent with the competitive rules of the European Economic Community. In any case, the statement of objections does not mean that the commission will necessarily render an adverse decision. Rather, it represents a preliminary view only.''
Lawyers familiar with Common Market law, however, say a statement of objections is a relatively serious matter, somewhat akin to a Department of Justice advisory opinion that a proposed merger is likely to violate United States antitrust laws.
Philip Morris has acquired a 22 percent interest equity holding in Rothmans International by becoming a partner in the tobacco holdings of Rothmans. At the same time, Philip Morris acquired some trademark rights in half the convertible bonds of Rothmans International held by affiliates of the Rembrandt Group, controlled by Anton Rupert, the South African financier.
In buying the stake last May, Philip Morris defeated its rival, R.J. Reynolds Industries, which had also been negotiating with Mr. Rupert. Philip Morris, which ranks No.2 in the international cigarette market, is best known for its Marlboro and Merit brands, while Rothmans, which ranks third, sells the Dunhill, Rothmans, and Peter Stuyvesant brands.

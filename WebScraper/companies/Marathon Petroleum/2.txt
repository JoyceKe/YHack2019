The first, which will keep the Marathon Oil Corporation name, will focus on exploration and productions, while the second, the Marathon Petroleum Corporation, will deal with refining, marketing and pipeline transportation. When the deal is complete, Marathon Petroleum will be the fifth largest refiner in the United States.
“The substantial improvement in the global business and financial environments over the last two years has created the conditions under which we believe it is now appropriate to move forward with the formation of two strong independent energy companies,” Clarence P. Cazalot Jr., the president and chief executive, said in a statement. “Marathon has a long history of adapting to changing market and business conditions, and at this point in our almost 125 year history there is a compelling strategic rationale for this transformation.”
The news of the split comes one day after the ITT Corporation announced that it would break itself into three companies. ITT, an industrial conglomerate, weighed other options, including a sale, but ultimately chose to form three businesses focused on water, engineering and military contracting.
“It was not a decision that was taken lightly,” Steven R. Loranger, ITT’s chairman and chief executive, said in an interview by phone with DealBook, “but over the past year, we came to conclusion that this was the right thing to do.”

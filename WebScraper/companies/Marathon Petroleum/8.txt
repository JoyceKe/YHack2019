The Marathon Oil Company said today that its Marathon Petroleum Ireland Ltd. subsidiary had arranged a $200 million production payment financing with a group of 10 banks led by the Chase Manhattan Bank and the Bank of Ireland. Proceeds will be used to repay a portion of advances received by Marathon Ireland from its parent, the company said. Marathon said the new facility supplemented a $100 million production payment financing that it arranged in 1977 to finance part of the development of the Kinsdale Head gas field.

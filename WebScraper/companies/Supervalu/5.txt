Supervalu Inc., a food distribution and supermarket company based in Eden Prairie, Minn., said yesterday that it had dropped out of the bidding for a $3.7 billion single-source contract with the Kmart Corporation because it would have to reduce profit margins to unacceptable levels to win the contract. Kmart said on Tuesday that it intended to allow smaller existing contracts with the Fleming Companies and Supervalu to lapse when they expire June 30 and replace them with a single distribution deal to stock 2,100 Big Kmart and Super Kmart stores.

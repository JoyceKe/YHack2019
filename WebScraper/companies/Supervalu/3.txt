Net income in the quarter ended Sept. 6 rose to $62.2 million, or 46 cents a share, from $58.8 million, or 44 cents a share, a year earlier, the company said. Sales rose 5.8 percent, to $4.59 billion from $4.34 billion.
Sales at stores open at least a year rose 2 percent in the quarter, while retail earnings as a percentage of sales fell. The company said increases in employee-benefit costs, especially health insurance, will affect earnings for the rest of the year.

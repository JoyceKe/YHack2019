Supervalu Inc., a food distribution and supermarket company, said yesterday that it would cut 4,500 jobs, or 7.3 percent of its work force, as it consolidates distribution centers and leaves some retail markets. The company took a charge of $153.9 million, or $1.16 a share, against earnings in the quarter that ended Feb. 24 to reflect the moves, Supervalu said. The revamping follows the loss of a food-distribution contract with Kmart that is expected to reduce revenue this year by $1.7 billion and per-share profit by 18 cents to 22 cents a share, the company said. Supervalu, based in Eden Prairie, Minn., also released results for the period, the fourth quarter of its fiscal year, and said it lost $93 million, in contrast to a profit of $72 million a year earlier.

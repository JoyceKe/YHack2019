The Sysco Corporation, North America's largest food service distributor, agreed yesterday to buy the closely held FreshPoint Holdings Inc., just months after the Fresh America Corporation canceled plans to buy FreshPoint, a fruit and vegetable distributor. Terms were not disclosed. FreshPoint, based in Dallas, is one of the leading distributors of wholesale produce in North America, with annual sales of about $750 million. Sysco, based in Houston, had sales of $17.4 billion in fiscal 1999. In September, Fresh America scrapped plans to acquire FreshPoint, without explanation.

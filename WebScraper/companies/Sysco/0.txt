The Sysco Corporation, North America's largest food-service distributor and marketer, said yesterday that it was buying the Newport Meat Company of Irvine, Calif. Terms were not disclosed. Separately, Sysco said it would buy back another eight million shares to improve shareholder value. The acquisition of the closely held Newport Meat, which has annual sales of about $100 million, is the Houston-based Sysco's first in California. Newport Meat supplies meats, game and frozen seafood to 1,000 restaurants, private clubs, gourmet food stores, and luxury hotels and resorts in southern California.

The McKesson Corporation said it had sold $125 million of convertible preferred stock to an employee stock ownership plan. The company said it would use proceeds to buy back about 3.7 million common shares, based on current prices, to offset dilution that would otherwise occur from the issuance of shares to the ESOP and for other corporate purposes. After the repurchase, the ESOP would hold about 18 percent of McKesson. McKesson's shares jumped $1 today, to $34.75, on the New York Stock Exchange.

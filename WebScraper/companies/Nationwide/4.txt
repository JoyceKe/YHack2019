Zambia was plunged into darkness in what appeared to be the second nationwide power failure in three days. The country relies on hydroelectricity, and national blackouts are rare. The electricity network went down around 7:30 p.m. and was restored about four hours later. There was no immediate explanation. On Saturday, the country lost electricity for eight hours. Neighboring Zimbabwe was also hit by a nationwide blackout over the weekend, and worsening power cuts have caused economic losses and chaos across South Africa.

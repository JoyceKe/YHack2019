Those cutbacks, which now seem to be worse than at any time since the 1990-1991 recession, are helping to slow down the economy, and to spur calls in Washington for more fiscal stimulus even before the arrival of checks starting next month as the government sends out money to most taxpayers.
In its "Beige Book" report on economic conditions, released this past week, the Federal Reserve said that surveys by the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks found that "consumer spending was characterized as softening across most of the country."
The strength in consumer sales, such as it was, was concentrated around Boston and New York â€” areas that, not coincidentally, attract many European tourists. With the dollar down sharply against the euro and the British pound, there are more foreign visitors and many of them find prices low compared to what they are used to back home.
The Census Bureau reported a small increase in retail sales for March, with overall sales up 1.8 percent over the previous year. But much of that gain was caused by higher prices. Sales at gasoline stations soared almost 19 percent as oil prices climbed. In food and beverage stores, sales were up 4 percent from a year earlier.
But spending more money on food and gasoline leaves less for other things, and sales were down, even without adjusting for inflation, at department stores, clothing stores and furniture stores, as well as at auto dealers.
The latest figure shows that such sales fell 4.5 percent during the first three months of this year, compared with the same period of last year. That is the deepest decline since the 1990-1991 recession.

The board made its ruling following a petition by the Office and Professional Employees International Union, which wanted the board to rule that Allstate's agents were not independent contractors under the National Labor Relations Act. Such a ruling would have allowed them to hold an election on forming a union.
The ruling is a victory for Allstate's chairman and chief executive, Edward M. Liddy, who led the insurer's effort to switch its agents from employees to independent contractors to reduce costs and increase their productivity.

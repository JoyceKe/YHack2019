The company, the largest publicly traded American home and auto insurer, said its net income rose to $767 million, or $1.73 a share, from $424 million, or 94 cents a share, in the comparable quarter a year earlier. Those figures included gains from investment sales this year and gains from sales of investments and a subsidiary a year earlier. The operating earnings, before those gains, rose to $559 million, or $1.26 a share, from $342 million, or 76 cents a share.
The strong profit at Allstate, one of the first property insurers to report quarterly earnings, is expected to be mirrored by other companies that were hurt a year earlier by claims from the East Coast blizzard.

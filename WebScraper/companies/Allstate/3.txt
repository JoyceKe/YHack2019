Allstate, the auto and home insurer, said yesterday that it would pay $34 million in restitution and a fine to settle claims by insurance regulators in California that it overcharged on about 250,000 policies over five years.
John Garamendi, the insurance commissioner in California, said policyholders who bought auto and home insurance from Allstate from 1999 to 2004, would receive $30 million in refunds or credits on future coverage.
Analysts said that disputes between insurance regulators and companies seldom resulted in large payments from an insurer. "Most insurance departments don't go after insurance companies to rebate policies." said Adam Klauber, an analyst at Cochran, Caronia Securities in Chicago.

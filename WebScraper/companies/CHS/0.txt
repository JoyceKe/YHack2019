The microcomputer distributor CHS Electronics Inc. agreed yesterday to sell its European operations to its senior managers in a transaction that it valued at about $300 million, most of which consists of the assumption of debt. The Miami-based company, which has been battling financial problems, said the agreement would relieve it of its long-term debt. Under the pact, CHS will also receive $11 million in cash -- or be relieved of an equivalent amount of liabilities -- and receive a 10 percent stake in the purchasing group. Shares of CHS closed at $1.50, up 12.5 cents.

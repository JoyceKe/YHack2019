The acquisitions of Ameritech Argentina S.A. and Compexpress Informatica Ltda. are expected to make CHS Electronics the leading computer products distributor in Argentina and Brazil. CHS Electronics of Miami, which distributes computers, floppy drives, modems and software, also agreed to buy Ameritech Exports Inc., a concern in Miami that distributes Compaq Computer products throughout South America, and Atlantis Skupina, which distributes computer products in Slovenia.

CHS Electronics Inc. said yesterday that it would buy 80 percent of the Hong Kong-based microcomputer distributor SIS Distribution Ltd. for $70.4 million. SIS Holdings, the distributor's parent, will keep the remaining 20 percent of the company. CHS, of Miami, will pay $28.16 million cash initially and $42.24 million a year later in cash or shares. The company distributes networking products and software to retailers and wholesalers, mainly in Europe and South America. The recent financial turmoil in Asia was one of the reasons for the acquisition, CHS's chairman and chief executive, Claudio Osorio, said, citing ''some excellent opportunities where price is concerned.''

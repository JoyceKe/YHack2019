The United Automobile Workers union and the General Dynamics Corporation's land systems division reached a tentative agreement on a three-year contract covering about 4,000 workers in Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania. Details were not released, but a U.A.W. official, who insisted he not be identified, said the pact included improvements in wages and benefits. A typical worker covered by the previous three-year contract, which expired Sunday at midnight, was paid $14.57 an hour.

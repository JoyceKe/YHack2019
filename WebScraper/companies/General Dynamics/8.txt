The General Dynamics Corporation's Electric Boat shipyard will shut down for two weeks during the Christmas-New Year holiday season, the the first shutdown of the shipyard in 35 years. All 18,000 employees will be affected, company officials said. Eletric Boat's general manager, Fritz G. Tovar, said in a memo that the shutdown was intended ''to provide for more efficient operations during a period of time when absenteeism is higher than normal and to take advantage of plant holidays.''

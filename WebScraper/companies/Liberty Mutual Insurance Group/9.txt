The Liberty Mutual Group in Boston yesterday named Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos in Boston, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies, to handle its insurance advertising, which had been handled for seven years by Kirshenbaum Bond & Partners in New York, part of MDC Partners. Spending was estimated at $60 million.
The decision came after a three-month review that had been narrowed to Hill, Holliday; Kirshenbaum Bond; and two agencies owned by Havas, Arnold Worldwide in Boston and Euro RSCG Worldwide in New York. Pile & Company in Boston managed the review.

Thursday’s announcement is part of a two-year initiative by ConocoPhillips to sell $15 billion to $20 billion of assets by the end of the year. The company has raised $10.7 billion from the divestitures, as well as an additional $9.5 billion from the sale of shares in Lukoil.
“ConocoPhillips has conducted business in Vietnam for more than 15 years, and we are pleased that Perenco has recognized the value of these quality assets,” Alan J. Hirshberg, a ConocoPhillips senior vice president for planning and strategy, said in a statement.

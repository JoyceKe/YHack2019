Abbott Laboratories said yesterday that it planned to buy back from investors up to 20 million of its shares. Abbott, a health care products company based in Abbott Park, Ill., will buy the shares occasionally on the open market. The company now has roughly 793 million shares outstanding, so the buyback would represent about 2.5 percent of all its shares. Abbott shares were unchanged yesterday at $39.50 on the New York Stock Exchange.

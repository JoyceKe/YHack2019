With the hospital and pediatric groups showing the best growth, all major areas of Abbott Laboratories contributed to the record results reported yesterday for the quarter and six months ended June 30. Net income for the quarter gained 32.7 percent to $28 million, or 94 cents a share on a sales gain of 21.4 percent to $304.9 million. This lifted the six‐month net by 30.1 percent to $53.2 million, or $1.79 a share over a year earlier on sales of $588.4 million, up 11.7 percent.
The results reflect in part the expansion into the rapidly growing medical‐supply field, according to the Standard & Poor's investment advisory service. It noted that the important I‐V solutions line will benefit from continued strong demand, higher prices and expansion into nutritional feeding.

The store's effort to build in Port Chester has taken nearly seven years. Dozens of public hearings have been held and multiple lawsuits filed. But it was not Port Chester but the neighboring community of Rye that tried to block Home Depot.
Because of a county statute that gives a neighboring community some voice in what goes on near its border, the city of Rye had the legal standing to fight the case. Also, the Rye Citizens Committee, a group opposing the store, fought its establishment in Port Chester.
Suits and pressure groups aside, Home Depot is now moving ahead on a 101,467-square-foot store and 18,000-square-foot garden center, the spokeswoman said. A May 1998 decision by the Appellate Division of the New York State Supreme Court in Brooklyn dismissed claims by Rye and the citizens committee that the store would overload streets, Ms. Blauvelt said.
The Atlanta-based Home Depot chain has stores in New Rochelle and Cortlandt and is building one in Yonkers. It is also considering stores in Mount Pleasant and Mount Vernon. In the United States and Canada, Home Depot has more than 518 stores. Twenty-eight are in New York.

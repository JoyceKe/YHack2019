"I think Home Depot will continue to be a great growth story through the end of the decade," said Christopher E. Vroom, a retail analyst with Alex. Brown & Sons. He estimates that the company's earnings will increase 33 percent this year, to $1.45 a share.
Home Depot's gross margin was down slightly during the fourth quarter and the fiscal year that ended Jan. 31, but higher sales and lower operating costs pushed more revenues to the bottom line. Sales in Home Depot stores open at least one year, or comparable store sales, climbed 15 percent in the fourth quarter.
Ronald M. Brill, the company's chief financial officer, said yesterday that the company, based in Atlanta, would continue to cut prices in some markets to keep its promise to have the lowest prices and gain market share.

Continental Airlines and United Airlines have made their electronic tickets compatible. This means either airline can issue an electronic ticket for a trip that involves a connection to the other. It also means that if a passenger holding an e-ticket on one line must be transferred to the other line because of a flight cancellation or labor dispute, the process of turning the original ticket into a paper ticket for endorsement won't be necessary.
The Continental-United arrangement has not yet been extended to travel agents selling e-tickets. They must use paper tickets until probably the end of the year for trips that connect between the two lines.
The interlining process, like the negotiating of international treaties, must go forward pair by pair. United already had an agreement with Air Canada, and Continental had arrangements with America West and Northwest, but the process has proved slower than the airlines expected. BETSY WADE

Berkshire Hathaway said on Friday that it had agreed to buy The Waco Tribune-Herald to expand in Texas. Berkshire is buying the newspaper, which has a daily circulation of 34,000, from the Robinson family, the company said. Terms were not disclosed. Warren E. Buffett, Berkshireâ€™s chief, has said that newspapers must rethink whether to offer free content on the Internet, and that publications with a community focus can thrive where there is little competition.

Berkshire Hathaway Inc., the investment vehicle of Warren E. Buffett, agreed to buy the Xtra Corporation, a container leasing company, for about $590 million, the companies said yesterday. Berkshire agreed to pay $55 a share and to assume another $710 million in Xtra's debt. Berkshire's investment comes as shipping companies that lease Xtra's equipment struggle in a slowing economy. Xtra said yesterday that profit in its most recent quarter fell 57 percent because of lower freight demand and increased costs. Julian H. Robertson Jr., the billionaire who leads Tiger Management and is Xtra's biggest shareholder, agreed to the transaction. Xtra will remain at its headquarters in Westport, Conn., and operate as a wholly owned subsidiary.

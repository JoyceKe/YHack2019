The Kroger Company will reopen about 40 of the 70 Detroit-area supermarkets it closed last month following approval Friday of a contract with its unionized meat cutters, a company spokesman said. Kroger, the nation's second-largest food retailer, will rehire about 2,800 of the 4,700 workers it laid off July 21, said Paul Bernish, a spokesman for the Cincinnati-based company.

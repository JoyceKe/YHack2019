Paul Bernish, a company spokesman, said most of the 88 employees at the suburban Detroit office would be laid off when most accounting responsibilities are transferred to Kroger's office in Indianapolis. Cincinnati-based Kroger said it planned to reopen another 29 stores in the area next week. It closed 70 stores July 21 after union employees rejected a contract that included wage concessions. Approval of a similar proposal allowed the 45 stores to reopen.

The Kroger Company said that it was negotiating to sell its drugstore operations to an investor group led by Philip E. Beekman, former president of the Seagram Company, and several executives of the drugstore division. Mr. Beekman has been a Kroger director since 1978.
The company said it hopes the deal can be completed within the next six weeks. Industry analysts have said that the stores, which had sales of about $1.15 billion last year, would fetch between $300 million and $400 million. Kroger said in July that it was seeking a buyer for the stores.

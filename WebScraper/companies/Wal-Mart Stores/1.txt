In the fourth quarter, the company, the nation's leading retailer, opened 33 Wal-Mart stores and 94 Sam's Club wholesale stores. Eighty-seven of the clubs were acquired from Kmart Corporation's PACE Club wholesale unit. As of Jan. 31, Wal-Mart had a total of 2,440 stores, up from 2,136 a year ago.
Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Ark., said earnings rose to $868 million, or 38 cents a share, from $749.5 million, or 33 cents, for the quarter a year earlier. Total revenues, including sales and other income, increased to $20.5 billion, from $17.2 billion a year earlier.
Janet Mangano, a Burnham Securities analyst, said Wal-Mart's expansion was "the likely reason" for the company's higher interest cost on debt in the quarter. Debt expenses rose to $103.8 million, from $41.5 million for the quarter a year earlier.
For fiscal 1993, Wal-Mart earned $2.3 billion, or $1.02 a share, compared with $1.99 billion, or 87 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose more than 21 percent in the year, to $67.9 billion from $55.9 billion.

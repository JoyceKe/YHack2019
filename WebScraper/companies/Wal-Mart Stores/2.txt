Wal-Mart Stores Inc. will make its first foray into New England with five discount stores planned in New Hampshire. The stores will be near the borders of Massachusetts and Maine to take advantage of shoppers from those states who come to New Hampshire to avoid their states' sales taxes.
Wal-Mart will also open a Sam's Wholesale Club in Scarborough, Me. Wal-Mart, based in Bentonville, Ark., operates largely in the Sun Belt and the Midwest. It operates 1,527 discount stores in 35 states, including 146 Sam's Wholesale Clubs and four Hypermart-USA stores.

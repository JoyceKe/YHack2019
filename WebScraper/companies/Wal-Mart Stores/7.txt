Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the nation's largest retailer, said yesterday that third-quarter earnings rose 13 percent, to $588.1 million, or 26 cents a share, as the company benefited from cost controls and a 21 percent revenue gain, to a record $20.4 billion.
Acquisition costs related to the purchase of Woolworth stores in Canada and Pace Warehouse stores from the Kmart Corporation weighed down earnings growth this year. However, David Glass, president and chief executive, said, those investments and "international development are beginning to show results, and we believe they will generate significant future earnings."
In the quarter, ended Oct. 31, companywide same-store sales, or sales at stores open for at least one year, rose 5.6 percent. Same-store sales at traditional Wal-Mart stores rose 7.4 percent, while Sam's Club store sales fell 0.7 percent.
The company continues to be comfortable with analysts' fourth-quarter estimates of about 46 cents a share and $1.18 to $1.20 for the year, Jay Fitzsimmons, a company spokesman said. A year ago, Wal-Mart posted fourth-quarter net income of $848 million, or 38 cents a share, on revenue of $21 billion.

J.P. Morgan Chase, which plans to merge with Bank One this year to become the second-largest bank in the United States behind Citigroup, has hired William Daley, a former commerce secretary, as chairman of its Midwestern banking division. Daley is the brother of Mayor Richard M. Daley of Chicago and the son of Richard J. Daley, the city's mayor and political boss for more than two decades. Daley resigned as president of SBC Communications, a local telephone company, last week after running the company since December 2001. He was commerce secretary under President Bill Clinton from 1997 to 2000.

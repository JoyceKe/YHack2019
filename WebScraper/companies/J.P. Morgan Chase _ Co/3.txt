Writing in CNBC’s SquawkBlog, Charles Gasparino says Mr. Dimon right away quashed rumors that he is considering reuniting the House of Morgan by merging with Morgan Stanley, calling such a move a potential “blood bath” in terms of the layoffs it would entail. But he does want to pursue a major bank or brokerage service to better compete against his old domain, Citigroup, and could be eyeing PNC, SunTrust or Wells Fargo.
Now one thing that Dimon made exceeding clear during the entire interview is that it’s highly unlikely that he will engage in any major acquisition any time soon. As we reported, he just completed his first acquisition since becoming CEO, buying the retail branches of Bank of NY. That was a $4 billion and Dimon concedes that JP doesn’t have the currency right now to make an acquisition that much bigger. “We have to earn the right to do deals,” he told me.

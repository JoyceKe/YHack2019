The large retirement investment firm TIAA-CREF said on Monday that it had agreed to buy Nuveen Investments, an investment management firm, for about $6.25 billion, to become one of the country’s top money managers.
TIAA-CREF has about $570 billion worth of assets, and it has been especially eager to diversify its offerings in mutual funds and other financial products, a mix that includes retirement plans, brokerage services and annuities plans.
The Nuveen purchase is expected to be a big step toward that effort. Nuveen, which was founded in 1898 and has focused heavily on municipal bonds for most of its history, has added various mutual and closed-end funds to its offerings over the years.
“For nearly a hundred years, we have been wise financial stewards for those who make a difference in the world in the academic and nonprofit communities,” Mr. Ferguson said in a statement. “The acquisition of Nuveen can generate greater returns that will benefit our customers.”
Nuveen earned about $45 million last year, swinging from a $571 million loss in 2012, according to regulatory filings. It reported about $1 billion in revenue for 2013, down slightly from the previous year.
TIAA-CREF is buying Nuveen from the private equity firm Madison Dearborn Partners, which bought Nuveen seven years ago, during the height of the credit boom, for nearly $5.8 billion. Madison Dearborn is expected to break roughly even on the deal.
“The clients of Nuveen, and each of our investment affiliates, will benefit from TIAA-CREF’s support of our multiboutique approach and from the continuity of our client services, our brands and our professionals, whose interests will remain strongly aligned with our long-term success,” Mr. Amboian said in a statement.

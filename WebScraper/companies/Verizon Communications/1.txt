More than a dozen hospitals in and around New York City lost phone service on Friday night, hampering their ability to answer the incoming calls of relatives who were seeking to speak with patients or check on their status.
Among the hospitals that were affected were those in the Northwell Health system, which runs about 20 hospitals in the area, including Lenox Hill Hospital and the Manhattan Eye, Ear & Throat Hospital on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, as well as hospitals in Brooklyn, on Staten Island and Long Island, and in Westchester County.
“Several Northwell Health facilities have been impacted by what we believe is a major regional phone outage that began Friday evening,” Mr. Molinet said. “This intermittent phone issue is affecting inbound calls only and automatically triggered our emergency operations plan, which includes the use of workaround systems. Our main goal is to ensure patient safety. We’re actively working with our phone carrier toward restoration.”
At 11:45 p.m., Mr. Molinet said phone service was being restored gradually by the hospitals’ main phone carrier, Altice, which runs Optimum phone and internet service in the region. He said the hospitals were using alternate phone carriers. He said he was not sure if the service interruption was because of the wind and rain from Tropical Storm Dorian, which was churning in the Atlantic Ocean off the Northeast coast on Friday night.

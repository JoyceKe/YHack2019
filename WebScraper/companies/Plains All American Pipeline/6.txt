Plains All American Pipeline, a marketer of crude oil, said yesterday that the Texas attorney general was investigating its purchase of Link Energy's oil pipeline operations on concern that the transaction would thwart competition. The state attorney general's office indicated that the investigation was prompted by complaints about the potential impact on competition in the Permian Basin in West Texas, Plains said in a regulatory filing. A spokesman for the attorney general declined to comment or to confirm the investigation. Plains bought 3,100 miles of crude oil pipelines from Link Energy, terminals able to store 3.4 million barrels of oil and 200 trucks for $273 million last week.

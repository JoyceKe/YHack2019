Plains All American Pipeline L.P. said today that unauthorized crude oil trading by an employee was expected to cause $160 million in losses and was forcing the company to renegotiate credit agreements.
Plains All American said the employee, whom it did not identify, appears to have violated a company policy that requires traders to match oil purchases with sales to customers or deliveries to fulfill New York Mercantile Exchange futures contracts. Outside auditors and lawyers are investigating, the company said.
The partnership, which is based in Houston and transports and sells oil in the South and West, said that its 1999 operating earnings would be lower and that past profits might have to be restated. Its ability to pay a quarterly distribution, the equivalent of a dividend, is also in doubt, the company said.
Plains All American said it and some affiliates were in default on the terms of some credit agreements because of the unauthorized trading and were in talks with banks to maintain the ability to borrow.
Plains All American owns a 1,233-mile pipeline that runs from California to Texas. It also owns three million barrels of crude oil storage space in Cushing, Okla., the delivery point for oil bought on the mercantile exchange. Plains All American does business with almost all major oil companies, traders said.
The trader who is accused of making the unauthorized transactions has been fired, Plains All American said. Most of the trading occurred from April through November, though it appears to have started in January, the company said. It did not elaborate.
''We are extremely disappointed by the unauthorized actions of one of our traders and are taking appropriate, swift and decisive action to see to it that our policies cannot be circumvented like this again,'' Greg Armstrong, Plains All American's chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. The company refused to comment further.

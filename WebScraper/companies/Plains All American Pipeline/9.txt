BP is selling its natural gas liquids as part of a plan to raise $45 billion by selling assets and businesses to strengthen its finances in the wake of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill disaster last year. BP said it would remain active in Canada.
The company has already agreed to sell about $20 billion in assets. In November, BP increased its sales goal to $45 billion, including the disposal of half of its American refining capacity in the Carson and Texas City plants. BP had set aside $40 billion to pay for costs related to the gulf oil spill.
In November, BP’s $7.1 billion deal to sell a majority stake in the Argentine oil producer Pan American Energy to the Bridas Corporation fell through. Bridas, a joint venture of Bridas Energy of Argentina and Cnooc of China, withdrew its offer because certain conditions were not met.
The Canadian natural gas liquids business, which employs about 450 people, includes plants and storage facilities, BP said. It owns assets that gather, store and distribute natural gas liquids in Canada and the Midwest.
“BP’s Canadian N.G.L. business is an asset-rich platform that significantly expands our L.P.G. asset footprint,” Greg L. Armstrong, chairman and chief executive of Plains All American, said in a statement.

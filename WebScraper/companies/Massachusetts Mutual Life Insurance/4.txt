Policyholders of the State Mutual Life Assurance Company of America have overwhelmingly approved the plan to convert to a stock insurance company from a mutual insurance company, the company announced yesterday. State Mutual said it would change its name to the First Allmerica Financial Life Insurance Company and become a unit of a new holding company, the Allmerica Financial Corporation. Policyholders, who in theory own a mutual company, will receive shares of Allmerica Financial or, in some cases, cash or credits on their policies. The Massachusetts Commissioner of Insurance must first approve the conversions before shares can be offered.

Barry Gottehrer, a spokesman, said Mr. Ingram's duties in the office of the president ''were still to be worked out, but I would assume they would relate to marketing.'' Mr. Clark and Mr. Ingram were not available yesterday for interviews.
Massachusetts Mutual is one of the true believers when it comes to whole-life insurance. It sees whole life - and not term insurance or the newer universal-life policy - as the basic policy of the industry.
Massachusetts Mutual, the nation's 11th-largest life insurance company, with assets of $11 billion, is in health insurance and pensions in addition to life insurance. ''Whole life is doing very well for the company,'' said Mr. Gottehrer, a senior vice president. The company has introduced a universal-life policy, but ''whole life is the product we believe in,'' he said.
Mr. Ingram moved from Greensboro, N.C., to the home office in Springfield, Mass., in 1971 to become vice president of the agency division. He was named vice chairman and chief marketing officer in 1980.

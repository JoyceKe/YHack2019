The AmerisourceBergen Corporation, a pharmaceutical distributor, cut its full-year earnings forecast yesterday because drug makers were limiting the amount of inventory that distributors could buy before price increases. Profit from continuing operations for the year ending in September will decline to $3.10 to $3.50 a share from $4.06 a year earlier, AmerisourceBergen said. To compensate for limits on stockpiling, AmerisourceBergen and other distributors are seeking new contracts that provide them with fees from drug makers for distributing medicines to pharmacies and hospitals. Some manufacturers have agreed to pay the fees; Pfizer, the world's largest drug producer, has refused. Shares of AmerisourceBergen, which is based in Valley Forge, Pa., dropped $7.08, to $54.03 a share.

The AmerisourceBergen Corporation, a drug wholesaler, forecast little change in sales and earnings for fiscal 2005 and said it might repurchase as much as $500 million in stock to increase per-share profit. An updated forecast will be given in November, when the company reports 2004 results, AmerisourceBergen said yesterday. Based on the company's stock price yesterday, the repurchase plan would allow AmerisourceBergen to buy back about 9.4 million of its 112 million shares outstanding. Earnings growth at AmerisourceBergen is being stifled by the loss of two big accounts, including a contract with the Department of Veterans Affairs that generated $1 billion in quarterly sales. Stock in the company, which is based in Valley Forge, Pa., fell $3.09, or 6 percent, to $49.91 a share.

The AmerisourceBergen Corporation, a leading drug wholesaler, agreed to buy the U.S. Bioservices Corporation for about $160 million in stock and assumed debt, adding to its specialty pharmaceuticals business that handles vaccines, cancer drugs and blood products. AmerisourceBergen may pay as much as $30 million more if U.S. Bioservices meets certain goals. The amount of debt was not disclosed. The venture capital firm Whitney & Company owns 58 percent of U.S. Bioservices. AmerisourceBergen, based in Valley Forge, Pa., will issue 2.4 million shares when the transaction is complete.

The Tesoro Petroleum Corporation will acquire Coastwide Energy Services Inc., an oilfield services company, for about $21 million in cash and stock. Under the agreement, each Coastwide share will be converted into the right to receive $2.55 in cash and 0.41 of a Tesoro share. Tesoro, an oil and gas producer and marketer based here, said the noncash part of the payment would be free of taxes to Coastwide stockholders.

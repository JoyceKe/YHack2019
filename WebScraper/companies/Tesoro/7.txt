The Tesoro Petroleum Corporation of San Antonio said it had agreed with the McMoran Oil and Gas company, a unit of Freeport-McMoran Inc., on a domestic exploration program for oil and gas. Tesoro said that it would pay McMoran about $33 million for a 25 percent share of McMoran's projects in the Gulf Coast and Anadarko Basin of Oklahoma, and that it would spend an additional $30 million to $35 million for exploration costs on these leases. About 100 exploratory wells are to be drilled during the next 18 to 20 months.

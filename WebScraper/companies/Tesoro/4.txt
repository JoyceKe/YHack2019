The Tesoro Petroleum Corporation, already the object of overtures from a Hong Kong oil-trading concern, said it had received an unsolicited $15-a-share takeover offer from Pentane Partners L.P., a New York investment group. The offer from Pentane, which owns 9.7 percent of Tesoro's stock, values Tesoro at $206 million. The large San Antonio-based oil and gas refiner, producer and marketer has about 13.7 million shares outstanding. The stock closed down 37.5 cents, at $11.25, in trading today before the offer was announced. Tesoro said it had referred the unsolicited proposal to a committee of its board. Earlier this month, Oakville N.V., a unit of Hong Kong-based Kuo Investment Ltd., said that it had raised its stake in Tesoro to 6.2 percent and that it might seek control.

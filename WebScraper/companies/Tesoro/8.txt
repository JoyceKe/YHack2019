The Tesoro Petroleum Corporation said it is terminating its previously announced agreement to buy an additional 1.29 million shares of the Enstar Corporation from Roy M. Huffington Inc. Tesoro continues to hold 172,600 shares, or 1.1 percent, of Enstar common and 17,260 shares of Enstar convertible preferred series A. It said it would continue evaluating its interest in Enstar, an energy concern, but has no current plans to purchase more shares.

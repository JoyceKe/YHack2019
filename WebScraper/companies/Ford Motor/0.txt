Fordâ€™s net income from July through September was $425 million, or 11 cents per share. But excluding restructuring charges, the company made 34 cents per share. That soundly beat Wall Street estimates that averaged 26 cents per share.
Its revenue fell 2 percent to $36.99 billion, partly because the company bungled the launch of the new Ford Explorer SUV. Explorer sales were down 48 percent for the quarter as quality problems forced Ford to hold shipments to dealers.

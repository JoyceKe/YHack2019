Ingram Micro Inc. said yesterday that its second-quarter profit fell by more than a third as the big computer distributor made changes to its pricing system and the way it tracks inventory. Net income fell 34 percent to $33.2 million, or 22 cents a share, from $50.3 million, or 34 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose 7.2 percent, to $7.3 billion from $6.8 billion. Ingram Micro is shifting its strategy as it recovers from several quarters of sluggish demand. Ingram Micro shares rose 62.5 cents, or 3.5 percent, to $18.75.

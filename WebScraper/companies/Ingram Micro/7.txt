Ingram Micro Inc., which distributes computer parts, had a fourth-quarter loss of $10.3 million because of restructuring costs, and the company said yesterday that first-quarter profit would not meet analysts' forecasts. The net loss was 7 cents a share, in contrast to a profit of $5.66 million, or 4 cents, a year earlier. Sales fell 4.1 percent, to $5.89 billion from $6.14 billion. North American sales, which account for half the company's total, declined 10.6 percent, the company said. Ingram Micro had costs after taxes of $39.5 million to pay for job cuts and the closing of operations in a program intended to generate $160 million in annualized operating income. The company said it expected a first-quarter profit of $21 million to $24 million, or 14 cents to 16 cents a share, excluding some costs, with revenue of $5.40 billion to $5.55 billion. Analysts expected profit of 17 cents a share and $5.55 billion in sales, according to a Thomson First Call survey. Shares of Ingram Micro were unchanged at $10.05.

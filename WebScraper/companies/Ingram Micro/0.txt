Ingram Micro Inc., the world's biggest computer distributor, said today that it had reached a preliminary agreement valued at about $10 billion to build and service machines that the retailer CompUSA Inc. sells directly to business customers.
CompUSA will close its distribution center in Grapevine, Tex., near Dallas, and turn over all distribution, custom assembly and configuration of personal computers to Ingram Micro for five years. CompUSA, the largest American retailer of personal computers, is already Ingram Micro's largest customer.
Ingram Micro is benefiting from a decision in May by the Compaq Computer Corporation, the world's biggest PC maker, to winnow distributors from 39 to just 4, including Ingram Micro. At the time, Ingram Micro said the move could add as much as $4 billion to its sales, which were $22.03 billion last year.

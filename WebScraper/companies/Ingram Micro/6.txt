Ingram Micro, the world's biggest distributor of computer parts, said yesterday that fourth-quarter sales would be at the high end of a company forecast and profit would meet or exceed analysts' expectations. Sales will be at the upper end of a forecast made in October for $5.75 billion to $5.90 billion, Ingram Micro said in a statement. The company said in December that sales would be at the lower range. Analysts expected profit of 18 cents a share, excluding some costs, according to Thomson First Call. The company did not provide an estimate for net income. Ingram Micro shares fell 16 percent on Friday after a rival, the Tech Data Corporation, said its fiscal 2004 earnings might decline as much as 25 percent from the previous year because of heightened competition and geopolitical uncertainty. Shares of Ingram Micro rose 8 cents yesterday, to $9.60. Ingram Micro will release full fourth-quarter results on Feb. 20.

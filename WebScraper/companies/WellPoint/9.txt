The Maryland insurance commissioner, Steven B. Larsen, has rejected a planned $1.4 billion purchase of CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield by WellPoint Health Networks, saying the bid was too low. WellPoint, the biggest health insurer in California, raised its bid from $1.3 billion in January as Mr. Larsen prepared to rule on the proposed purchase. Mr. Larsen said a recent study done by the New York investment adviser Blackstone Group put CareFirst's value at $1.45 billion to $1.65 billion. Lawmakers in Maryland had demanded an all-cash bid because the state would get some of the proceeds. WellPoint wanted to add Maryland-based CareFirst's 3.2 million customers. WellPoint, which has 13.2 million customers, mostly in California, the Midwest and the Southeast, said it would review Larsen's decision and decide whether to take other steps.

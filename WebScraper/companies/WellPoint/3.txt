Shares of Wellpoint Health Networks Inc., one of California's biggest health insurers, rose yesterday after an announcement that its shares would be included in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index after the close of trading yesterday. The shares rose $2.6875, to $86.125, on the New York Stock Exchange. The company will replace Harnischfeger Industries, the world's biggest mining-equipment maker, in the index. Harnischfeger filed for bankruptcy protection on Monday. Companies' shares often rise when they are added to the S.& P. 500 because many mutual funds that try to mimic the performance of the index must buy the shares.

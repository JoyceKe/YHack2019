WellPoint, the giant health insurer, is near a deal to acquire WellChoice, the largest health insurer in New York State and the parent of Empire Blue Cross Blue Shield, for about $6.5 billion in cash and stock, according to executives close to the negotiations.
A deal, if completed, would give WellPoint, already the nation's largest health insurer with 28 million members, an expanded foothold in the Northeast. More important, a deal in New York would put it in direct competition with Oxford Health Plans in New York, a unit of UnitedHealth Group, WellPoint's acquisitive rival.
Indeed, a deal between WellPoint and WellChoice has long been speculated about as a possible counter to UnitedHealth's $8.14 billion acquisition of PacifiCare Health Systems this summer. WellPoint itself is the product of a merger last year of the nation's two largest Blue Cross and Blue Shield companies, WellPoint Health Networks and Anthem. Both PacifiCare and WellPoint have millions of members in California.
The five million members of Empire would see little change immediately if there is an acquisition of WellChoice. Health insurers have argued that by growing in size, they can increase their negotiating leverage with hospitals and doctors and deliver lower costs to consumers. The companies also say that by raising money from investors, they can finance the heavy costs of information technology.
But a few states, including Kansas and Maryland, have in recent years blocked takeovers of some nonprofit Blues plans, objecting to large rewards for executives and contending that health plan members would face higher costs after a merger.
Deal-making by health insurers has been fueled in part by the sharp gains in their stock prices. Stocks have risen on expectations that spending on health care will continue to rise at a rapid clip as the baby boomer generation ages and demand surges for new treatments and advanced care.
The executives close to the negotiations warned that the talks between WellPoint and WellChoice were at a particularly delicate stage last night and could still collapse. But the executives said they hoped a deal could be announced as soon as today.
Under the terms of the deal being discussed last night, WellPoint would pay about $77 a share in cash and stock. That would represent a 9.1 percent premium to WellChoice's closing price of $70.60. Shares of WellChoice, which went public in November 2002 at $25 a share, have risen 32 percent so far this year.
The discussions have been particularly complicated because a huge stake of WellChoice is held by the New York Public Asset Fund, which was established when the state gave Empire permission to convert from a nonprofit business in 2002 into a publicly traded concern. A deal would give the fund, which holds about 60 percent of WellChoice's shares, about $4 billion.
Under legislation pushed in 2002 by Dennis Rivera, head of the politically powerful health workers' union 1199/SEIU, with support from the Greater New York Hospital Association, much of that money has been earmarked for the paychecks of 1199 members. It was unclear last night whether the fund would continue to hold a stake in the combined company.
Analysts have long advocated a merger between WellPoint and WellChoice. Charles Boorady, an analyst with Citigroup, wrote a note to investors in June predicting such a marriage. The combination of the two, he wrote, "would make sense strategically for both companies because of synergy between WellPoint's CT Blue plan and WellChoice's New York Plan."
"In addition to the obvious back-office synergy, WellPoint manages its pharmacy benefit (PBM) in house and both companies would be able to lower prescription drug spending by moving WellChoice members onto WellPoint's PBM," he added.

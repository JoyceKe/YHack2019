The subpoena, which seeks information related to TAP's drugs Lupron and Prevacid, was received April 22 from the United States attorney's office in Boston, WellPoint said in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The pharmacy benefit managers Caremark Rx Inc. and Express Scripts Inc. also said this month that they had received subpoenas from the same office concerning their relationships with TAP, a venture of Takeda Chemical Industries of Japan and Abbott Laboratories.

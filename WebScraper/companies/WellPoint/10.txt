WellPoint, one of the country’s largest health insurers, is adjusting to an industrywide shift by making a string of investments to increase its interaction with consumers. Last year, the company bought CareMore, a provider of managed care for the elderly, for about $800 million. It has also made strategic investments in Bloom Health, an online insurance service, and FitOrbit, a consumer fitness program.
“We see WellPoint migrating from a business-to-business company to a business-to-consumer organization,” Wayne S. DeVeydt, WellPoint’s chief financial officer, said in an interview with DealBook on Monday morning. “The consumer will be the primary customer.”
The retailer, which has about 3.3 million customers, should complement WellPoint’s vision insurance business, which serves 4.2 million members. WellPoint plans to maintain its partnerships with brick-and-mortar lens and frame retailers, including Target and Pearle Vision.
The acquisition will also allow WellPoint to participate in the higher margin business for lenses and frames. While WellPoint has after-tax margins of 4 to 5 percent, 1-800 Contacts has double-digit margins, according to Mr. DeVeydt.
The transaction, which is expected to close in the third quarter, is valued at close to $900 million, according to The Wall Street Journal. The deal is expected to weigh on earnings this year, costing WellPoint about 4 cents a share.

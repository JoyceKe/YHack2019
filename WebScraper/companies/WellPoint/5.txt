Blue Cross of California reached a definitive agreement today to recapitalize Wellpoint Health Networks Inc. in a deal that will result in a charitable foundation initially holding more than 80 percent of the new Wellpoint.
Wellpoint shareholders are to receive 0.667 share of the new entity for each current share. The company is to be created by the merger of Wellpoint into Blue Cross after Blue Cross converts to for-profit status.

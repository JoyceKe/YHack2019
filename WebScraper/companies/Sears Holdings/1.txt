Mr. Freidheim, the former co-chief administrative officer and executive vice president of Lehman Brothers, will become an executive vice president of operating and support businesses at Sears Holdings, the company announced Tuesday.
Mr. Freidheim worked at Lehman Brothers for 17 years and remained at the company after it was forced to declare bankruptcy in September and began selling off units to companies like Barclays and Nomura.
At Sears, Mr. Freidheim will oversee the corporate division managing areas like human resources and brand strategy, and he will oversee Sears’s business like Lands’ End. Mr. Freidheim became familiar with Sears in 2004, when Lehman advised on the Sears-Kmart merger.

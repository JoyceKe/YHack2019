The Sears Holdings Corporation, the company formed by Kmart's acquisition of Sears, Roebuck & Company, will be rated one level below investment grade, Standard & Poor's Ratings Service said yesterday. The combined company's debt will be rated BB+, the highest noninvestment level, S.&P. said. Sales and margins may be hurt as Sears Holdings integrates its two businesses, an S.&P. analyst, Jerry Hirschberg, said in a conference call. Kmart's purchase of Sears for about $11 billion is expected to close next month. Moody's Investors Service rated Sears Holdings Ba1, also one level below investment grade, on Wednesday.

Every fifth day, the Dodgers right-hander Derek Lowe relies on baseball’s nastiest sinker to frustrate hitters. He has a 14-8 record and leads the majors by recording 79.6 percent of his outs on ground balls. The four other days he spends playing some of the country’s most famous golf courses. His best round is a 67, and he shot a 76 at Winged Foot Golf Club on Thursday. Next week, when the Dodgers are in Chicago, Lowe has a tee time at Medinah, the site of last month’s P.G.A. Championship. On road trips, Lowe said, he packs his clubs before he packs his clothes. BEN SHPIGEL
Tiger intimidates people more than any athlete I’ve ever seen, even more than Jordan. There’s a reason why everyone who is paired with him in the final round of a tournament suddenly forgets how to play golf. Have you ever looked at them? They’re beaten before they even step on the course.
Probably a shot a hole. And, since this is my fantasy, we’d be playing at Augusta National. That’s the ultimate. But then again, they know that course so well, so it would probably be more. Maybe I’d take them out the night before and get a few drinks in them.

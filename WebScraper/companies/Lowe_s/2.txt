No one word is sufficient to describe the happenings in the N.B.A. over the past six months. From the crowning of an unexpected champion to an off-season of stunning free agency moves, the league has upended so much of what we had come to know to be true.
As a new season begins, we are faced with a new set of truths — the Golden State Warriors could miss the playoffs; the Los Angeles Clippers could win it all — and a need to risk being wrong about everything.
With a nod to the actress Keke Palmer, who blessed us all with the viral phrase “sorry to this man,” we predict who won’t finish the season with his or her current team, who will win major awards like most valuable player, and which will be the one team standing at the end.
Sorry to: Mike D’Antoni. James Harden and Russell Westbrook don’t mesh, everyone’s angry at the Rockets for lost China revenue, but D’Antoni takes the fall because the league can’t cave on firing Daryl Morey, Houston’s general manager.
Sorry to: Enes Kanter. As much as his easy inside buckets will look great on offense, his defense will drive Celtics Coach Brad Stevens crazy. He’ll lose his job to Robert Williams or Tacko Fall or a radical small-ball approach — did anyone else see Jaylen Brown play center for U.S.A. men’s basketball? — leading Kanter to complain repeatedly, which will lead to his early exit through a trade or release.
Sorry to: The Wizards, as we know them. They will struggle as usual, and hopefully they’ll see the light and parlay Bradley Beal for a true rebuild at the end of the season. Not sorry that Beal will be leaving Washington, but sorry to him for having to be stuck in mediocrity-land for so long. (I’m from D.C. I can say it.)
Wild prediction: If he stays with the Thunder (and maybe even if he doesn’t), Steven Adams will make his first all-star team. He’s only 26! And Jimmy Butler and Dion Waiters will begin trading insults in the press before James Harden and Russell Westbrook do.

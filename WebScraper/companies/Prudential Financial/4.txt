If completed, the deal for the two units, the AIG Star Life Insurance Company and the AIG Edison Life Insurance Company, would be the latest by A.I.G. to raise money to help pay back its $130 billion taxpayer-financed bailout.
The insurerâ€™s chief executive, Robert H. Benmosche, had previously said that the firm planned to keep the two units. Prudential Financial and A.I.G. began talks last year, but they fell apart. They resumed talks this year.
It is planning on holding an initial public offering for American International Assurance, after failing to complete a deal with Prudential of Britain, which is unrelated to Prudential Financial. It has also agreed to sell another life insurance unit, the American Life Insurance Company, and a consumer lending business, American General Finance.
But A.I.G. has hit bumps in its road to pay back taxpayers. The talks with Prudential of Britain fell apart amid shareholder opposition, and the Taiwanese government recently moved to block the sale of another A.I.G. life insurance unit, Nan Shan.
Mr. Benmosche has placed a priority on selling off noncore operations to help the company raise enough proceeds to pay back the government. He has said that only by shedding its bailout burden can the firm resume life as a normal company.

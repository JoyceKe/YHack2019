Prudential’s fines and restitution may be among the biggest payments made by firms implicated in fraudulent fund trading, the person said. Prudential has set aside at least $900 million for settlement and litigation costs since 2003.
Prudential may be the first company in the industrywide investigation to settle under threat of federal criminal prosecution. Massachusetts officials sued the company over so-called market timing in 2003, saying it let brokers make excessive and illegal trades to benefit hedge-fund clients at the expense of long-term investors. Two former brokers pleaded guilty to fraud charges in 2005.
Prudential’s settlement will resolve state investigations, as well as inquiries by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the person confirmed. Prudential sold the securities brokerage that was the focus of the investigation to the Wachovia Corporation five months before Massachusetts and the S.E.C. sued.
Dozens of firms, including brokerages, money managers and hedge funds, have settled since the New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, triggered investigations of the $9.3 trillion fund industry in 2003.

American Express has considered dining perks one of the main benefits for its card members, helping them book tables at hot spots and offering them rewards points for doing so. Now it is taking a new step into the industry — by buying the country’s biggest privately held restaurant reservation service.
Resy and American Express had already been partners, but the card giant decided several months ago that buying Resy made sense, said Chris Cracchiolo, American Express’s senior vice president for global loyalty and benefits.
American Express is hoping that the deal works out better than Booking Holdings’ $2.6 billion takeover of OpenTable in 2014 — which was followed by a $941 million write-down of the acquisition two years later.

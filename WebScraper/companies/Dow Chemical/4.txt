The Dow Chemical Company, the fifth-largest United States chemical company, agreed today to buy a European synthetic rubber business from the Royal Dutch/Shell Group in an effort to expand its own profitable rubber operations. The companies declined to disclose terms of the purchase or the revenue of the business. Dow Chemical will gain plants in Berre, France, and in Pernis, the Netherlands.

The Federal Trade Commission said it would seek a court order to block the sale of the Safeway Stores Inc. division based in El Paso, to Furr's Inc., a Lubbock, Tex., grocery store operator. The proposed $144 million sale of the 60 Safeway stores in Texas and New Mexico could reduce competition, the F.T.C. said.

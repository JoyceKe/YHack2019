Safeway Stores Inc. said it would begin a pilot project with a subsidiary of the Lamar Savings Association to open a series of banking centers in six stores in the Houston area. Safeway, which is based in Oakland, Calif., said the centers would allow shoppers to cash a check, open new accounts, apply for home or personal loans, buy traveler's checks or transact most other types of banking business. Safeway said state regulators had approved the six pilot locations.

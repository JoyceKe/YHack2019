Safeway Inc., the supermarket chain, today reported improved results for the quarter and year that ended on Dec. 29. It attributed the gains to better buying practices, tighter inventory controls and higher sales in its specialty departments, like prepared foods, which have higher profit margins.
For the quarter, Safeway, based in Oakland, Calif., reported earnings of $27.7 million, or 28 cents a share, compared with a loss of $21.1 million a year earlier. Its sales rose 2.6 percent, to $4.63 billion, from $4.51 billion in the 1989 quarter. The 1989 results reflect a $46 million tax expense on a $460 million dividend from Canadian units.

The El Paso Corporation, owner of the largest network of natural gas pipelines in the nation, said yesterday that it had sold its remaining interest in Enterprise Products Partners to the closely held Epco Inc. for about $425 million. El Paso, based in Houston, said the sale would result in a gain of more than $150 million, which it would use to repay debt. The company said the sale moved it closer to its goal of reducing debt to about $15 billion this year from $17.1 billion at the end of 2004. Shares of El Paso rose 2 cents, to $10.66, on the New York Stock Exchange.

Under the terms of the deal, Duncan, a provider of natural gas services, would receive 0.95 of an Enterprise common unit for each of its outstanding publicly traded units. The offer, valued at $42 a share, is 29 percent above Duncan’s closing price on Tuesday.
For Enterprise, a deal would allow the company to absorb Duncan in full and expand its operations. The energy company already owns DEP Holdings, and it controls 58 percent of Duncan’s outstanding shares.
Enterprise has made several investments in the last two years to expand its pipeline network: in 2010, it paid M2 Midstream $1.2 billion for two natural gas systems, and in 2009 it acquired pipelines from Chevron Midstream and bought out Teppco Partners for $3.3 billion.
Enterprise, a major provider of midstream energy services, has more than 50,000 miles of pipelines, concentrated in the United States and Gulf of Mexico. Duncan, which transports and stores natural gas and petrochemicals, has a large footprint in Texas and Louisiana.

UnitedHealth will pay $61.50 a share for Catamaran, a 27 percent premium over Friday’s closing price of $48.32 a share. It is the latest big acquisition in the health care industry, which is in the midst of a surge of deal activity. And it represents a further consolidation of the pharmacy benefits management business.
Catamaran, which is based in Schaumburg, Ill., will be combined with UnitedHealth’s pharmacy services business, OptumRx. Catamaran manages more than 400 million prescriptions each year on behalf of 35 million people — or about one in every five prescription claims in the United States.
“We believe this combination will create significant value for health plan, government, third-party administrator and employer customers and, most importantly, the individual consumers who depend on us for accurate, affordable and convenient pharmacy benefit products and services,” Larry Renfro, chief executive of Optum, said in a statement.
“Our board of directors carefully considered a variety of strategic options and unanimously concluded that this combination is clearly in the best interests of our shareholders,” Mr. Thierer said. “Together, we believe we will have the talent, scale, technology resources and innovative spirit.”

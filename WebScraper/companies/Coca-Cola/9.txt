The East Africa Bottling Share Company, which produces the soft drink in the region, last week temporarily shut its bottling operation in Ethiopia. It said they had the Coca-Cola — but did not have the bottle tops.
Ethiopia’s shortage of foreign currency means the local bottling company cannot import crown cork, the squishy white material found inside bottlecaps. The cork seals the bottle, maintaining the drink’s carbonation.
Perhaps Coca-Cola is trying to set up a greater need for their product by limiting its distribution for a while. It is, after all, the same company that wanted to replace Classic Coke with New Coke and caused a panic in the ’80s, at least in this drinker of the original beverage.
Schott’s Vocab is a repository of unconsidered lexicographical trifles — some serious, others frivolous, some neologized, others newly newsworthy. Each day, Schott's Vocab explores news sites around the world to find words and phrases that encapsulate the times in which we live or shed light on a story of note. If language is the archives of history, as Emerson believed, then Schott’s Vocab is an attempt to index those archives on the fly.

Less than a month after signing a landmark deal that changes how it does business with doctors and consumers in Texas, the health insurance giant Aetna Inc. said today that it planned to relax some managed-care policies in Connecticut.
The move is part of the company's efforts to make changes one market at a time to business practices and policies that landed Aetna and its managed-care industry peers at the center of criticism from those who say they are more concerned with profits than members' health needs.
Eager to mend battered relations with doctors and deflect a series of class-action lawsuits and other legal entanglements, Aetna announced seven policy changes at Aetna US Healthcare, its health insurance unit, during a meeting of the Connecticut State Medical Association.
They include the elimination of capitation agreements for primary care physicians with small practices, relaxing its mandatory ''all products'' requirement and allowing specialists to act as primary care physicians for very sick patients.
Connecticut's attorney general, Richard Blumenthal, who has been investigating Aetna, said the changes were ''a good start.'' But he said the company should end its practice of paying a fee for each patient, which ''wrongly shifts the risk of health care to physicians and their patients.''

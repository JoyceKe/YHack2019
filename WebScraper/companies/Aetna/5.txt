Heavy losses from insurance claims for asbestos and environmental pollution that have plagued the Aetna Life and Casualty Company in recent years have now contaminated its blue-chip life insurance subsidiary, which yesterday lost its top-notch AAA rating from the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
Aetna Life has not been directly burdened by the environmental-cleanup claims or the bad real estate investments that have hurt other Aetna units. But Mark Puccia, an S.& P. analyst, said, "We were not comfortable with a large rating gap between the property and casualty subsidiaries and Aetna Life and Annuity."
Aetna's property and casualty subsidiaries were reduced to the "good" category of A+ from the "excellent" category of AA-. The Aetna Life Insurance Company, which holds most of the bad real estate loans, was unchanged at A+.

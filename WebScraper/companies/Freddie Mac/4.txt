The action, which takes effect Aug. 2, follows the Supreme Court decision last Monday that Federally chartered savings and loan institutions could ban the so-called assumption of old mortgages despite state laws to the contrary.
The corporation, commonly known as Freddie Mac, owns from 700,000 to 900,000 mortgages across the country. It is one of the agencies that buys mortgages from lending institutions financing housing. Homeowners do not usually know when their mortgages are in the hands of Freddie Mac because their original lender still collects payments for the agency.
Freddie Mac's decision, reached Friday, does not affect Federal Housing Administration or Veterans Administration loans, which still can be fully assumed. Those mortgages are controlled by the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
The practice of passing on low-interest mortgages has benefited only a few home buyers, said Richard A. Mackey, executive vice president of Freddie Mac. When low-interest mortgages are assumed, lending institutions must raise interest rates on new loans more than they would otherwise have to do to keep pace, he added.

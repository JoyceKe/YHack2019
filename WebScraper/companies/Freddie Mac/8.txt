The Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation is offering $200 million of 8 1/4 percent subordinated capital debentures due in 2016 at a price of 97.30, to yield 8.50 percent, through underwriters led by Salomon Brothers Inc. The debentures, which are non-callable before maturity, yield about one percentage point more than 30-year Treasury bonds.

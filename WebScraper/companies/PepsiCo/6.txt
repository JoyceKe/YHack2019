Pepsico Inc. will pay $25 million for 40 percent of Wedel, Poland's largest candy company, the Government said. The investment is the biggest yet by a foreign partner in a state-owned Polish company that is being privatized, it said. Wedel, founded in Warsaw in 1851, sold chocolate products and biscuits valued at $58 million last year. Pepsico plans to invest $56 million over five years to modernize Wedel's operations and build a new factory.

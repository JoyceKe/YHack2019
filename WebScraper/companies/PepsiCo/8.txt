Twenty-five miles north of its corporate home in Purchase, N.Y., Pepsico, the soft- drink conglomerate whose products now range from snack foods to sporting goods, is building a new headquarters for its worldwide beverage operations. The building is going up on a 212-acre wooded spread next to the Croton Reservoir in Somers between Interstate 684 and Route 35.
The new 580,000-square-foot building will house administrative, technical and computer service personnel for both the domestic and international operation of Pepsi-Cola and Pepsico Wines and Spirits International, a division of the company now quartered at the Purchase facility. A spokeman for the company said that other buildings are also planned for the site.
The Eggers Group, the Manhattan firm that served as both architects and site planners for the project, designed the building to fit into the side of a hill, with levels rising to between four to nine stories above grade level. The rough-finished granite used for the exterior walls will be carried into the main lobby and a view of the reservoir will be afforded from the glass-walled reception area. In addition to office and computer space, the building also will house dining facilites, a bank, and a fitness center for some 2,000 employees. Occupancy is scheduled for mid-1986.

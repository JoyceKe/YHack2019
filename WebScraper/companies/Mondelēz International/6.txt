The company, which was split from Kraft in 2012, said sales slid 7 percent to $8.8 billion, and its earnings dropped more than 70 percent to $500 million, or 29 cents a share, in the quarter that ended Dec. 31.
Profitability looked far worse than it was because in the same quarter a year ago, the companyâ€™s bottom line was plumped by an almost $3 billion settlement it won in a dispute with Starbucks. Adjusted for that extraordinary event, negative currency swings and other nonoperational charges, earnings rose 26 percent, to 47 cents a share, in the latest quarter.

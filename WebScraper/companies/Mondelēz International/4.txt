Mondelez International, the maker of Cadbury chocolate and Chips Ahoy cookies, is carving out its coffee business to combine it in a joint venture with a Dutch company to form a global coffee seller with more than $7 billion in annual revenue. The joint venture will join Mondelez Internationalâ€™s coffee portfolio with D.E Master Blenders 1753 of Amsterdam, giving the combined company control of coffee brands including Gevalia, Tassimo, Senso and, outside the United States, Maxwell House. The new company will be called Jacobs Douwe Egberts and will be based in the Netherlands. After the combination, Mondelez International, which was spun out of Kraft Foods in 2012, will receive about $5 billion in cash and a 49 percent equity stake in the joint venture.

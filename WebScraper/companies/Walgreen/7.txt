But Walgreens recently started selling fruit, vegetables and packaged meals in a national pilot program that will include about a dozen Manhattan stores. Now, a trip to drugstores can include everything from mangoes and yogurt parfait to spicy tuna rolls and salsa-making kits.
On a recent afternoon at a Walgreens in Times Square, a narrow refrigerator island flanked by shelves of touristy trinkets and bags of Halloween candy stood stocked with Greek salads with crumbly feta cheese, as well as plums, oranges, apples and bananas in wicker baskets. A ham and cheese sandwich on pretzel bread sold for $4.99 and was marked to expire five days later. There were fruit cups for $1.99.
“My first thought was, ‘When did this become a supermarket?’ I was confused,’’ said a customer, Lynette Andrews. She was more interested in the prepared foods than the produce, in convenience and not dinner ingredients.
That’s what Walgreen’s is hoping for. “We launched this pilot to provide fresh foods for customers who are looking to save time or possibly eliminate time from sitting down in a restaurant,’’ said Tiffani Washington, a Walgreens spokeswoman, “or even something fast to prepare for dinner that night.”
A similar program began this summer in Chicago, where Walgreens started carrying more fresh food in neighborhoods it identified as “food deserts,” where residents lack easy access to produce and other healthy items. Besides fruits and vegetables, the stores also sold frozen meats and fish, rice and beans.

SAN FRANCISCO, Oct. 23 - Cisco Systems plans to announce on Monday a new method -- based on a widely used Internet telephone standard -- for marrying the frequently incompatible radio gear used by emergency services agencies and businesses.
For instance, while fire and police radio systems are not normally interoperable, the Cisco method would connect them. Indeed, communication problems between the fire and police departments in New York proved to be a major problem on Sept. 11, 2001, according to the commission that investigated the events of that day.
The new approach is known as Internet Protocol Interoperability and Collaboration Systems, or Ipics, and it essentially converts voice traffic on radios and cellphones into data traffic over existing networks.
"From a pure military standpoint, it would be a big asset," said Bradley J. Curran, a military communications analyst at Frost & Sullivan, a business consulting firm in San Antonio. "Ultimately there will be more money in military markets for this kind of application."
"The conventional wisdom in the radio industry is to replace systems," Mr. Giancarlo said. He estimated that such an effort nationwide might cost government agencies more than $30 billion. Ipics could be deployed for about one-tenth the cost, he said.

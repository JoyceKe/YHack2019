Cisco Systems Inc. and the private investment firm Clayton, Dubilier & Rice agreed yesterday to acquire 80 percent of Telecom Italia's computer network equipment unit, Italtel, for $765 million. The two investors hope that by forging an alliance with Cisco and by making the company independent from its Italian parent, it will become more competitive. The investors said they hoped to sell shares of the new company to the public soon. Andrew Ross Sorkin

Cisco Systems Inc. said yesterday that it would purchase Combinet Inc., a closely held maker of computer network equipment. Cisco, the biggest independent maker of network equipment, said the acquisition would expand its line of products for people who work from home on personal computers connected to their office networks. Cisco, which is based in San Jose, Calif., said it would exchange 2 million Cisco shares for all the stock of Combinet. The deal was initially valued at about $114.2 million, based on the closing price of Cisco stock on Wednesday. As the price of Cisco shares rose yesterday -- they closed at $58.25, up $1.1875, on Nasdaq -- the indicated value of the deal rose to $116.5 million. Combinet, which is based in Sunnyvale, Calif., said it would have revenue of about $18 million to $20 million in the current fiscal year.

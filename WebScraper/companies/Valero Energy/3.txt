Salomon Inc. said yesterday that it would sell its oil-refining unit to the Valero Energy Corporation for $485 million in cash and stock, shedding a business that has steadily lost money. The agreement to sell Basis Petroleum Inc. will result in a $290 million after-tax loss for Salomon, which is based in New York, requiring it to restate its fourth-quarter earnings to a loss. On the New York Stock Exchange yesterday, Salomon fell $1.50, to $52.625, while Valero rose $1.125, to $33.625. Valero, of San Antonio, said the agreement would not affect plans to spin off its refining and marketing business, of which Basis now will be a part, and to merge its natural-gas services business with the PG&E Corporation. Valero will pay cash and $120 million of its stock.

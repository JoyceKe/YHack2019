The Valero Energy Corporation has had its $5.3 billion acquisition of the Ultramar Diamond Shamrock Corporation cleared by antitrust enforcers. The Federal Trade Commission said it approved the takeover after Valero agreed to sell a San Francisco-area Ultramar refinery and divest itself of 70 Beacon and Ultramar gasoline stations in Northern California. The F.T.C. vote to accept the divestitures clears the way for Valero to complete the takeover that will create the second-largest U.S. oil refinery, behind the Exxon Mobil Corporation. The combined company will have 12 refineries in the United States and Canada. Valero, which owns no gasoline stations, will acquire 5,000 Ultramar retail outlets.

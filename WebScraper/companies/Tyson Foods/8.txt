Sales in the period, which ended July 1 and was the third quarter of Tyson’s fiscal year, fell 4.8 percent, to $6.38 billion, from $6.71 billion as avian flu concerns and mad cow bans hurt exports of beef and poultry.
The results “reflected the challenging protein environment,” said Farha Aslam, an analyst with Stephens Inc. “We are optimistic about the chicken business as production cuts should support pricing and profitability and beef should benefit from company efforts to improve plant efficiencies,” she said.
Tyson forecast a full-year loss of 41 cents to 51 cents a share. On May 1, the company had said earnings would range from a loss of 25 cents a share to profit of 10 cents. The yearly loss would be the company’s first since fiscal 1994, when the company lost $2.1 million.
Beef operations had a loss of $10 million, compared with profit of $36 million a year earlier. Tyson said it was hurt by poor operating conditions at its Lakeside Packers operation in Brooks, Alberta and a strengthening Canadian currency, which reduced export sales.
The operating loss in beef was Tyson’s fourth straight as export markets like Japan and South Korea remained closed. Japan lifted its mad-cow disease-related ban on United States beef last week. It had been in effect since December 2003, except for a five-week period late last year and early this year.

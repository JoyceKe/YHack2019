Net income was $160 million, or 42 cents a share, compared with a net loss of $102 million, or 27 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales in the period, which ended Jan. 2 and was the first quarter of Tysonâ€™s fiscal year, climbed 1.7 percent, to $6.64 billion.
Tyson said that sales volume increased 7.2 percent at its beef division and that chicken sales were helped by a 2.8 percent price increase. The company predicted prices for chicken would improve during the fiscal year, helped by cold storage inventories.

Net income in the three months ended June 28 fell to $79 million, or 23 cents a share, from $107 million, or 30 cents a share, the company, based in Springdale, Ark., said. Sales rose to $6.33 billion from $5.9 billion.
Chicken profit, excluding taxes and interest, plunged 55 percent, to $47 million from $105 million, as the company closed a plant and paid more for feed grain. In prepared foods, profit fell 81 percent on declining unit sales, higher prices of raw materials, costs for new products and a work stoppage at one plant.
Tyson had ''a lot of upfront spending'' in the quarter with the introduction of more than 80 products, said Gregg Tenser, who helps manage $9.75 billion at NWQ Investment Management in Los Angeles, which owns 579,758 Tyson shares. The company is ''setting themselves up for a lot of strength going forward.''

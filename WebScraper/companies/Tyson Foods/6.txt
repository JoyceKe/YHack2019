Tyson Foods Inc., the world's largest meat processor, said today that its quarterly profit jumped almost sixfold on higher chicken prices and the acquisition of beef and pork business from IBP Inc. last year.
Net income rose to $107 million, or 30 cents a share, in the three months ended June 29, from $19 million, or 9 cents, a year earlier, Tyson said. Revenue, in the period, the third quarter of Tyson's fiscal year, tripled to $5.9 billion from $1.92 billion, reflecting the new IBP businesses.
Russia, the world's top poultry importer, halted purchases from the United States in early March, citing concern over the safety of disinfectants used in processing and the adequacy of testing for certain bacteria. Shipments have been slow to resume since the ban was lifted April 15, contributing to an abundance of meat.

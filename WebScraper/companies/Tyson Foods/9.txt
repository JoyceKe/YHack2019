Tyson Foods Inc. said today that its earnings soared in its fiscal first quarter as the company benefited from the acquisition of the beef and pork producer IBP Inc. and as profit margins on chicken improved.
Net income rose to $126.9 million, or 36 cents a share, in the three months ended Dec. 29, compared with $27 million, or 12 cents, in the 2000 period. Revenue rose to $5.86 billion from $1.77 billion, reflecting the addition of IBP.
Cheaper hogs and cattle reduced the cost of pork and beef processing from IBP slaughterhouses. Cattle prices fell 7.6 percent in the quarter and hog prices fell 5.5 percent, the company said. Chicken profit grew as prices rose and Tyson sold more to restaurants and supermarkets.
Results matched Tyson's Jan. 3 estimate, and the company increased its forecast for the current fiscal year, saying profit would be $1.10 to $1.20 a share. Earnings in the current quarter will be 17 cents to 20 cents a share, the company said.
Feedlots are fattening fewer cattle, signaling reduced availability of slaughter-ready animals and higher prices. The prospect of more expensive cattle comes as recession and declining exports hurt demand for beef.

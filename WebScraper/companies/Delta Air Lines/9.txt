The boards of Delta and Northwest have both scheduled emergency board meetings for Tuesday where the deal, which would reshape the airline industry, could be approved, these people said. Still, these people cautioned that several outstanding issues still needed to be resolved — including reaching an agreement with the pilots’ unions — and that the negotiations could be delayed or collapse altogether.
If a deal is reached, it would end months of speculation about a combination of Delta and Northwest, which would create the world’s largest airline. Such a merger would also probably spur more consolidation: United Airlines and Continental Airlines also have been holding merger discussions and are likely to announce their own deal. United and Continental are eager to announce their merger soon after any Delta-Northwest tie-up, so that regulators can look at both deals at the same time.
A softening economy and high fuel prices have convinced many in the industry that carriers must pursue the cost cuts available through mergers to avoid sinking back into the financial problems they have struggled to overcome.

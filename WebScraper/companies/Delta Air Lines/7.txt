The humble baggage tag will become the focus of advertising for Delta Air Lines in a campaign centered on passenger satisfaction that begins on Saturday. The campaign, with a budget of $100 million, is the first from the Leo Burnett Company in Chicago since Burnett replaced Saatchi & Saatchi as the Delta agency in September.
Delta, based in Atlanta, is the largest airline client for Burnett, part of the Leo Group unit of BDM Inc., since 1996, when the agency lost the account of United Airlines, part of the UAL Corporation. The concentration on pleasing passengers is conveyed in ads portraying customer requests, which range from ''Fly with bigger pillows'' and ''Just get me there!'' to ''Fly me home'' and ''More breakfasts.''
A poor response to the previous Delta campaign was a reason Saatchi & Saatchi in New York was dismissed after two and a half years. The new campaign from Burnett is part of a revamping of the Delta brand identity that will include a redesigned Web site, www.delta-air .com, and new employee uniforms.

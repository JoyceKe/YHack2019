Cardinal Health, the medical products and services company, agreed Wednesday to pay $600 million to settle a lawsuit filed by shareholders accusing it of accounting irregularities and inflated earnings. In a regulatory filing, the company denied any wrongdoing and said it settled to eliminate the uncertainties and expense of further litigation. The settlement is subject to approval in Federal District Court.

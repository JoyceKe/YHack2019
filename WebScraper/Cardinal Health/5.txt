Cardinal Health Inc., the drug distributor, said yesterday that Richard Miller had resigned as chief financial officer after federal regulators intensified an investigation into its accounting. Cardinal will delay releasing full financial results for fiscal 2004 and the fourth quarter until late August or early September so that Michael Losh, who was hired to replace Mr. Miller, can review them, Cardinal said. The Securities and Exchange Commission has subpoenaed information about Cardinal's financial practices, including how it recognizes revenue, the company said in June.

A unit of the General Dynamics Corporation has paid the Government $8 million to settle charges it defrauded the Army on a contract to make the M-1 Abrams tank, the Justice Department said. It said the payment settled a suit filed in Detroit in 1990 charging that the unit failed to provide the Army with its most current, complete and accurate cost data for production of the tank in 1983. The suit charged General Dynamics had a computer tape that listed the prices it planned to pay various subcontractors for 4,600 parts, but did not make it available to the Army.

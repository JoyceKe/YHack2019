Boeing said profit from continuing operations gained 38 percent, to $1.21 billion. General Dynamics, the largest producer of armored vehicles for the American military and No. 2 maker of business jets behind Bombardier, said net income jumped 32 percent, to $572 million.
Deliveries rose 8.5 percent for Boeing airliners and 23 percent at General Dynamics’ Gulfstream aircraft unit, where a weak American dollar helped overseas orders surpass United States bookings last year. Pentagon spending lifted profit 49 percent at General Dynamics’ combat group and 10 percent in Boeing’s military business.

The venture will be formed through Berkshire Hathaway's reinsurance unit, the General Re Corporation. A partnership led by the executives, Roberto Mendoza and Peter Hancock, will buy a majority interest in General Re Securities Holdings, a unit of General Re.
Mr. Mendoza left Morgan, where he was vice chairman, earlier last year to join the Goldman Sachs Group as an investment banker. Mr. Hancock, credited by Morgan as one of the architects of its derivatives business, resigned as chief financial officer in September, days before the announcement that the Chase Manhattan Corporation would acquire Morgan. The $32 billion acquisition was completed on Dec. 31.
''Roberto Mendoza and Peter Hancock are the kind of people I want to be in business with,'' Mr. Buffett said in a statement. ''I have great confidence in the business plan and prospects of Gen Re Securities.'' General Re said it would keep a substantial minority stake in General Re Securities.

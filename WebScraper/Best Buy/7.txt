The Best Buy Company, a leading chain of electronics stores, and Motorola Inc. said today that they had agreed on a two-year partnership to increase sales of Motorola's wireless products and to attract customers to Best Buy's new wireless department. The terms were not disclosed. Motorola's wireless products, including phones and pagers, will be prominently displayed at most of Best Buy's 412 stores by midyear, the companies said in a statement. Motorola, the No. 2 maker of cellular phones in the world, will provide Best Buy's wireless department with educational videos and other materials. Best Buy has doubled the floor space it devotes to wireless products and is placing the department near the front in most of its stores, said the company, which is based in Eden Prairie.

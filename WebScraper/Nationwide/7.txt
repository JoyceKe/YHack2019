Like many other insurers, including, most recently, the Cigna Corporation and the Aetna Life and Casualty Company, Nationwide decided this year that enough was known about its asbestos and environmental liabilities to estimate the total amount needed to pay those claims.
Nationwide is a mutual company, meaning it is owned by its policyholders. It said that it would end the year with $5 billion in surplus funds, or capital, and that it remained strong enough to continue expanding its property and liability businesses.
Nationwide, which is based in Columbus, Ohio, and includes the Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company and the Wausau group of companies, is the nation's seventh-largest property and liability insurer, selling to individuals and businesses.

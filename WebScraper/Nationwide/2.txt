The First Nationwide Bank, a unit of the Ford Motor Company, said it had completed the acquisition of Uptown Federal Savings of Chicago for an undisclosed amount. Uptown Federal, which has deposits of about $1.5 billion and $2 billion in assets, operates 22 retail branches in Chicago and its northern suburbs, the company said. It said the acquisition increased First Nationwide's asset base to about $19 billion and raised its retail branch network to more than 370.

Nationwide Mutual Insurance said on Wednesday that it has agreed to buy the portion of Nationwide Financial Services, its provider of life insurance and annuity products, that it does not already own for $2.4 billion.
Nationwide Mutual said it would pay $52.25 per share for Nationwide Financial’s class A shares, an 11 percent premium over its original bid in March. The new price is also a 38 percent premium over Nationwide Financial’s stock price then.

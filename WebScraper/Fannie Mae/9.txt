The Federal National Mortgage Association, known as Fannie Mae, which buys mortgages from issuers, yesterday priced $150 million in medium-term notes due in 1996 through Salomon Brothers. Noncallable by Fannie Mae for a year, the notes have a 7.41 percent coupon and are priced at 100, to yield about 18 basis points more than the when-issued five-year Treasury note.

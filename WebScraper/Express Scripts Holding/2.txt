A White House microphone, accidentally left on after President Bush completed a closed-circuit broadcast to a California audience, today confirmed what some reporters had long suspected: some of Mr. Bush's seemingly spontaneous exchanges with the public are actually scripted beforehand.
The President complained about problems with the scripted exchanges after a question-and-answer session with a teachers group, the Association of Christian Schools International, which is holding its convention in Anaheim, Calif. Mr. Bush spoke from the White House, a technique he frequently uses in "appearances" before small conventions, and his remarks were carried on speakers in the White House press room for reporters.
But Mr. Bush's microphone remained on after the broadcast ended, and reporters heard him grouse that the questions his audience had asked him had not come in the order in which his staff had apparently prepared him. 'They Flip-Flopped'
"These questions!" Mr. Bush told an unnamed aide. "We've got to get this sorted out here. It happened last week, too. Something's going awry here. I mean, if I just listen to the question, I can answer whatever it is. But if I think it's going to be on here, I don't listen to the question. I just look at this," he said, referring to a prepared answer.

The Sysco Corporation, a North American food supplier to restaurants, agreed to buy the Serca food-service unit of Sobeys Inc., a leading Canadian grocer, for 440 million Canadian dollars ($280 million). The purchase will triple Sysco's Canadian sales, which currently total about 900 million Canadian dollars, and will immediately bolster earnings, the chief operating officer, Richard Schnieders, said. Sysco, which will use debt to finance the purchase, wants to expand through acquisitions. Serca is Canada's No. 1 provider of food to restaurants, hotels, fast-food chains and institutions like hospitals.

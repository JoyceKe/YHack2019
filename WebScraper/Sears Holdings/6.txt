Sears Holdings, the company to be formed by Kmart's acquisition of Sears, Roebuck, said it would list its shares on the Nasdaq stock market, ending Sears's run of 95 years on the New York Stock Exchange. Sears began trading on the Big Board on March 3, 1910. Kmart was delisted from the New York Stock Exchange in December 2002 after it filed for bankruptcy. Kmart agreed to buy Sears for $11 billion on Nov. 17. A New York Stock Exchange spokesman, Christiaan Brakman, said the move by Sears had been expected. Nasdaq did not say what symbol the combined company would trade under.

Sears Holdings extended a bid to acquire all of Sears Canada's shares until March 31 after the proposal was backed by just 9.5 percent of shareholders when an initial deadline expired late last week. The directors of Sears Canada recommended against the offer, valued at 16.86 Canadian dollars ($14.52) a share. With the shares that have been tendered, Sears Holdings now owns about 63 percent of the Canadian retailer. Sears Holdings ruled out increasing its offer for the company, based in Toronto, as well as any extensions of its deadline. An independent appraisal has valued the stock as high as 22.25 Canadian dollars ($19.16). Sears Holdings said it would support eliminating Sears Canada's dividends if the privatization bid failed. Six independent directors of Sears Canada have said they would not stand for re-election next month because of differences with Sears Holdings. The American company said it intended to replace them with employees.

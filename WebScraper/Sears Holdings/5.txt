The Sears Holdings Corporation, created last week by the Kmart Holding Corporation's purchase of Sears, Roebuck & Company, will lay off at least 250 workers at its headquarters in Hoffman Estates, Ill., as the company streamlines operations. Sears Holdings gave notice of the job cuts March 29, according to a statement on Web site of the Illinois Department of Commerce and Economic Opportunity. Layoffs of at least 250 employees must be posted 60 days in advance, according to Illinois law. Sears Holdings employs about 4,000 people in Hoffman Estates and about 1,000 at the office in Troy, Mich., that was Kmart's base. The company will keep the vast majority of its 336,000 workers in the United States, the chief executive, Alan J. Lacy, said last week.

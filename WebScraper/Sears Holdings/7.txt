Sears Holdings was offering 18 Canadian dollars a share ($15.82) for a total of nearly 895 million Canadian dollars ($786.7 million) to obtain the 46 percent of the Sears Canada it does not own. But since the bid was proposed late last year, it has been beset by shareholder resistance and legal challenges. Because of a decision by Ontario’s securities regulator, only some of the votes by Sears Canada’s minority shareholders, who twice rejected earlier offers, were counted after a special meeting on Tuesday. Just 38.5 percent of that group backed the bid. Sears Canada is based in Toronto.
Separately on Tuesday, an Ontario court rejected a request from Sears Holdings to hear an appeal of an earlier court decision upholding the ruling by the securities regulator, the Ontario Securities Commission.
“Today was a great day for minority shareholders in Canada,” said Richard A. Rubin, managing partner at Hawkeye Capital Management, a hedge fund based in New York that is among the minority shareholders of Sears Canada. In a statement, Sears Holdings, based in Hoffman Estates, Ill., said it would not improve its offer and instead let it expire.
In August, the securities commission found that Sears Holdings had failed to disclose that it held support agreements for its bid from three large Canadian banks that are major Sears Canada shareholders, which were excluded from the final count on Tuesday. Sears Holdings said that if those votes had been included, 58.3 percent would have backed its bid and approved the takeover.

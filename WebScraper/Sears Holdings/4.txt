But sales at domestic stores open at least a year, including both Sears and Kmart, fell 2.3 percent. The Kmart increase was offset by a 4.6 percent decline at domestic Sears stores open at least a year, a result of weaker sales in its home appliance, lawn and garden, tools and home electronics categories.
Even with the decline, the quarter represented Sears’s best performance since the fourth quarter of 2007 and showed it had outperformed competing home improvement chains. Home Depot‘s same-store sales in the United States fell 7.1 percent during the quarter and Lowe’s fell 7.5 percent.
Sears lowered borrowing costs and increased the amount available under its revolving line of credit, a key source of funding as its builds inventory for the year-end shopping season. The company said it did so by issuing more commercial paper, a form of unsecured short-term finance usually reserved for companies with high credit ratings.
Food for thought: I have reviewed the Investor Information for May 2009 and understand the struggles the company is going thru with the decline in profit. I was a card holder of Sears and i am aware that as a card holder I am nothing more then a fish in the ocean with Sears, remind you with out the fish there would be no ocean. Advisement, when looking in to the credit history of your card holders you may want to review over the history of your customers value. Going off past history credit checks will not show the loyalty a card holder has with Sears. Sears has lost my family business after being a loyal card holder with them for many years. I am only one card holder but you have just lost about an estimated 6,000 a year from my family. I now REFUSE to allow one red cent to be spent at any branch of the company. I am only one person but add all the card holder that was loyal to the company and was over turned for this reason only, well there goes just 1 reason for the decrease in gross that the Corporation is over looking.

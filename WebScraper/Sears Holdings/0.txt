That assignment had been handled since 1993 by the Chicago office of Y&R, which will continue to handle other tasks for Sears that include the creation of campaigns for Sears product brands like Craftsman tools, DieHard automotive supplies and Kenmore appliances.
The Sears and Kmart retail chains have been suffering from declines in same-store sales — stores open more than a year, which is an important measure of retail health. Those declines have persisted even after sales for many other retailers have recovered after the recession.
Sears Holdings executives have a policy of only discussing quarterly results when quarterly earnings are announced, a spokeswoman said. So in a telephone interview on Tuesday, David Friedman, president of marketing at Sears Holdings in Hoffman Estates, Ill., declined to discuss the results at the two chains.
As part of the Sears brand assignment, Mr. Friedman said, McGarryBowen will also create campaigns for Sears’s private-label products, bearing brand names like Covington, as well as new merchandise that is being sold in collaboration with the British retailer French Connection U.K. and the celebrity Kim Kardashian.
Y&R, part of the Young & Rubicam Brands unit of WPP, has handled the Sears account on its own since August 2005, when it added the product brand assignments from another WPP agency, Ogilvy & Mather Worldwide.
McGarryBowen has also recently gained assignments from marketers like Kraft Foods and Verizon Communications. The agency is also a finalist in a review for the creative account of the Burger King fast-food chain.
For the Sears brand review, there were three finalists. The others, in addition to McGarryBowen, were Fallon Worldwide in Minneapolis, part of the Publicis Groupe, and Hill, Holliday, Connors, Cosmopulos in Boston, which like DraftFCB is owned by the Interpublic Group of Companies.

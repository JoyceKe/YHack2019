While profit fell for a fourth straight quarter, results topped analyst forecasts, making Bank of America the latest big U.S. bank to exceed estimates. The bank's shares rose 8.8 percent to $29.90 in pre-market electronic trading.
Countrywide lost $2.33 billion in the quarter, including just under $4 billion of credit-related losses. Bank of America expects the merger to add to profit in 2008, after previously saying it would not affect earnings per share.
Bank of America is the nation's second-largest bank by assets. Among other lenders, JPMorgan Chase & Co and Wells Fargo & Co reported smaller-than-expected profit declines, while Citigroup Inc had a milder-than-expected $2.5 billion loss.

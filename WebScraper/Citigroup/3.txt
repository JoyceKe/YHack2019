Among the scores of kiosks and stalls within the Urbanspace market halls, there’s a new one with a difference in the Vanderbilt location. Meryenda, from the chef Edie Ugot, serves Filipino dishes, like crisp and nicely spiced pork and shrimp lumpia; pancit, or glass noodles, with pork belly, sausage and vegetables; and chicken adobo over jasmine rice. Ms. Ugot is the first participant in the restaurant incubator, the Citi Test Kitchen, at this location. It’s a cooperative effort between Citi and Urbanspace to encourage new entrepreneurs with a rent-free space. Meryenda will be in residence for five months at this stall.

WellPoint, the health-insurance provider, said yesterday that its chairman, Leonard D. Schaeffer, had resigned from the board and that the chief executive, Larry C. Glasscock, would add those duties to his current positions.
Mr. Schaeffer, 60, the former chairman and chief executive of WellPoint Health Networks, is stepping down one year after Anthem Inc. bought the company and took its name. Mr. Glasscock, 57, also serves as WellPoint's president, the company said.
WellPoint agreed in September to buy WellChoice, New York's biggest health insurer, for $6.5 billion. The terms of that agreement call for a member of WellChoice's board to join WellPoint's board upon completion of the merger. Mr. Schaeffer said in a statement that his departure would make room for the new board member.

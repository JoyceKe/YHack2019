Pepsico Inc. said it had signed a definitive agreement covering the previously announced purchase of the Kentucky Fried Chicken Corporation from RJR Nabisco Inc. Pepsico said the price, based on Kentucky Fried Chicken's book value, was now estimated at $840 million, down from $850 million estimated when the tentative agreement had been announced. The company said the transition was expected to close in early fall pending final approval by directors of both companies.

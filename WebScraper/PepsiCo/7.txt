Pepsico Inc. said it had decided to end its franchise relationship with Source Perrier's subsidiary, Compagnie Francaise de Boissons Gazeuses S.A., at the end of next year because it failed to produce the desired results. Source Perrier is the mineral-water giant based in France. ''We have taken this action to safeguard our market position, which has, in fact, shown consistent decline over the past 10 years and to protect the future of our brands given the enormous growth potential of the French soft drink market,'' Pepsico said.

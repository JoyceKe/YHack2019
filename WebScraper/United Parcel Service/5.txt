Operations of the United Parcel Service have been halted in 15 Eastern states, including New Jersey and Connecticut, by a strike of 18,000 warehousemen and deliverymen represented by the Teamsters Union.
Department stores in the affected states were reported urging patrons to carry home their own packages, and other shippers were turning to parcel post or special trucking services for delivery of packages.
On a normal day, the United Parcel spokesman said, about 80,000 shippers, mostly business concerns, send 1.6 million packages by United Parcel to 800,000 other companies or individuals in the 15 states affected by the strike.

Freddie Mac and its larger sibling, Fannie Mae, were both taken over by the federal government in September amid losses because of a decline in the value of their holding, receiving a lifeline of $200 billion.
Mr. Moffett had been in the post since September, and had been a senior adviser to the Carlyle Group, a private equity firm in Washington, before joining Freddie Mac. He had also served as U.S. Bancorpâ€™s finance chief for nearly 14 years, overseeing financial reporting, treasury operations and real estate functions, as well as the asset and wealth management group. He left the bank in 2007 after he was passed over for the top job.

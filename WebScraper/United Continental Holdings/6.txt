The Justice Department said late Friday that it had approved the planned $3 billion merger between United Airlines and Continental, lifting the biggest regulatory hurdle to the creation of the world’s top airline, Jad Mouawad writes in The New York Times.
The Justice Department said it had closed its review following a “thorough investigation” of the proposed merger after Continental agreed to lease 18 pairs of takeoff and landing slots at Newark Liberty International Airport to Southwest Airlines to resolve competition concerns.
If the deal is completed, one entity, called United Continental Holding Inc., would operate the two companies as separate airlines for a year until the Federal Aviation Administration issues a single operating certificate.
Although some analysts had warned that the merger could raise antitrust concerns, particularly in the New York area, where Continental has a hub in Newark, the government approved the deal in record time. While few expected regulators to oppose the merger, the approval surprised some analysts who had predicted the process to take until the end of the year.

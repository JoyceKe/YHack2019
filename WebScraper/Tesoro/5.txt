The Tesoro Petroleum Corporation said the deadline for an agreement on the proposed sale of its 49.9 percent interest in Trinidad-Tesoro Petroleum Company to the Government of Trinidad and Tobago has been extended until Nov. 12.
The deadline was previously set for today. Tesoro said negotiations could be extended beyond the expiration date by the parties, and added that there was no assurance the proposed sale would be agreed upon or completed. Trinidad-Tesoro Petroleum produces about 36,000 barrels a day of crude oil.

The Tesoro Petroleum Corporation said that its board of directors had rejected a takeover offer from Pentane Partners L.P., calling it deficient and not in the shareholders' interest. Under the proposal, Tesoro's common shareholders other than Pentane would exchange their shares, totaling 66.9 percent of Tesoro, for 34.6 percent of the surviving corporation plus $6 a share, Tesoro said. Tesoro said that, according to the Pentane plan, Pentane's current 7 percent stake in Tesoro would increase to at least 51 percent of the surviving corporation.

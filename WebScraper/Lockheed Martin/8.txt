Lockheed Martin's government electronic systems plant has been awarded a $35 million contract for engineering and technical work on Japanese naval destroyers, Representative Jim Saxton, Republican of Vincentown, announced last week. Work on the ships, which are equipped with the Aegis advanced radar system, is expected to be completed by July 1997.

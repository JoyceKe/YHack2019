Already battered by recent announcements that three other companies -- Mobil Oil, Carter-Wallace and Hill Refrigeration -- are closing operations in East Windsor Township, Mercer County got some more bad news yesterday. The Lockheed Martin Corporation said it will move its Astro Space operations to Sunnyvale, Calif. Astro Space, which manufactures spacecraft, employs about 3,200 workers in East Windsor Township. The company said some workers would be offered jobs at other plants.

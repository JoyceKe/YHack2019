As part of a two-year plan to reduce debt through, among things, the sale $10 billion worth of assets, ConocoPhillips said it intended to halve its 20 percent stake in Lukoil in a sale on the open market, as well as divesting itself of other assets, according to the news service.
“The message we want to stress is that we’re returns-focused,” Conoco’s chief, James Mulva, told The Chronicle. “We’re doing everything we can to improve the returns to the shareholder on our portfolio, our investments.”

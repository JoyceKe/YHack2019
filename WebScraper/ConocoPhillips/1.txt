ConocoPhillips in Houston has named Dailey & Associates in West Hollywood, Calif., as agency of record on the consolidated retail account of the Conoco, 76 and Phillips 66 brands. Total spending was estimated at $20 million.
The account was consolidated and placed in review in August, after Conoco Inc., whose retail assignment had been handled by Fogarty Klein Monroe in Houston, merged with the Phillips Petroleum Company, whose retail assignments for the 76 and Phillips 66 brands had been handled by Dailey.
The decision came after a two-month review that included Dailey, part of the Partnership division of the Interpublic Group of Companies; Fogarty Klein; and Campbell-Ewald in Warren, Mich., part of the FCB Group division of Interpublic. Campbell-Ewald continues as agency of record on the ConocoPhillips corporate account.

Net income rose to $2.01 billion, or $2.86 a share, from $1.31 billion, or $1.90, a year earlier, the company said. Sales climbed 31 percent, to $34.7 billion. Per-share profit was 29 cents higher than the average estimate of 21 analysts surveyed by Thomson First Call.
Refining profit, which makes up a bigger share of earnings at ConocoPhillips than at Exxon Mobil or ChevronTexaco, the nation's biggest oil producers, rose 46 percent, to $708 million. Earnings from exploration and production jumped 47 percent, to $1.42 billion.
The company, based in Houston, expanded in countries with growing oil production, including Vietnam, Russia and Venezuela, as output declined from older fields in the United States and the North Sea. It is using gains in cash flow spurred by record prices to increase shareholder dividends and pay off debt.
Oil production rose from wells in Vietnam and the Timor Sea and declined everywhere else, the company said. Gas output fell everywhere the company did business except Norway and Vietnam. ConocoPhillips left unchanged its full-year production target at the equivalent of 1.56 million barrels of oil a day.

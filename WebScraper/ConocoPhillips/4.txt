ConocoPhillips agreed to proceed with a $5 billion project in Qatar to convert natural gas to diesel and other fuels, expanding its presence in a country that has the world's third-largest gas reserves. ''We are looking forward to a more definite agreement in 2004,'' ConocoPhillips's chief executive. James J. Mulva, said at a news conference in Doha, Qatar, where he signed a statement of intent for the plant with the Qatari oil minister, Abdullah bin Hamad al-Attiyah. The first phase of the project would start as early as 2009 and would produce half of the plant's full output target of 160,000 barrels of fuel a day, Mr. Mulva said. ConocoPhillips is based in Houston.

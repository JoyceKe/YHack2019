The nuclear processor British Nuclear Fuels P.L.C. said it would pay $:40 million ($61 million) in compensation to the Kansai Electric Power Company of Japan for falsifying safety data on a fuel shipment. Part of the compensation could be made in services. A shipment of mixed uranium and plutonium oxide fuel, which was found last year to have falsified safety information, will be returned to Britain. British Nuclear Fuels said last year that it had found ''some falsification'' of safety data on pellets used in the nuclear fuel rods it makes from reprocessed fuel at its plant in Sellafield, England. The problem led Kansai to reject a shipment of fuel last December.

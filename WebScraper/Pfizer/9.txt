Pfizer Consumer Healthcare, the makers of over-the-counter products like Zantac, Neosporin and Listerine, broke ground Tuesday in Morris Plains on a research and development complex that is being built with state incentives to keep and increase pharmaceutical jobs in the state. Observing that New Jersey is known as the nation's medicine chest for its concentration of pharmaceutical companies, Acting Gov. Richard J. Codey joined Pfizer officials at their 175-acre campus here to trumpet the news of the $25 million in tax incentives the state has given the company. The building and an adjacent parking garage are the first steps in what the company said will be a $500 million capital program there. The incentives are the first under the state's Business Retention and Relocation Grant program, which is nearly a year old. Ronald Smothers

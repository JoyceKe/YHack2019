Oracle also announced financial results for its first fiscal quarter on Wednesday afternoon, a day earlier than expected. It and other established tech companies are facing pressure as customers shift from paying upfront to use software run on their own computers in favor of subscription offerings delivered through cloud services.
The company, whose summer quarter is often its weakest of the year, reported that net income had declined 6 percent on flat revenue when compared with a year earlier, though Oracle executives pointed to other metrics indicating its own cloud offerings are gaining traction.
“Though we all worked hard together to close the first quarter, I’ve decided that I need to spend time focused on my health,” Mr. Hurd, 62, said in a message to employees. “At my request, the board of directors has granted me a medical leave of absence.”
Mr. Hurd, considered one of the most capable managers in the technology industry, spent 25 years at the business-technology company NCR before moving to Silicon Valley to become chief executive of Hewlett-Packard. He led HP for five years before he was ousted in 2010 after a high-profile scandal over his relationship with a consultant to the company.
Mr. Hurd was swiftly hired by Oracle, which competes with his old company and has fought legal battles with other software companies and Google. Lately, he has been particularly involved in Oracle’s response to the shift to cloud-based subscription offerings.

Joker Phillips, the Kentucky offensive coordinator, will eventually become the Wildcats’ coach after Rich Brooks’s retirement. Brooks, 66, has not set a timetable for his retirement, the university said. He signed a contract extension through 2011 on Friday that will pay him $1.6 million a season. Phillips would become the university’s first black head football coach.

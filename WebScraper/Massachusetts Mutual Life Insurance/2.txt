The Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company is trimming 551 jobs in Springfield, Mass., and Hartford through early retirement. The company offered early retirement to more than 700 employees this summer as part of an internal expense management move, said Eustis Walcott, vice president for corporate communications. He said the number of acceptances was in the range the company had expected. Mass Mutual, which merged in 1996 with the former Connecticut Mutual Life Insurance Company, based in Hartford, now has more than 3,700 workers at its Springfield headquarters and more than 1,100 in Hartford.

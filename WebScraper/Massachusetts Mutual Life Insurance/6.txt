The Massachusetts Department of Insurance said yesterday that it had approved the conversion of the State Mutual Life Assurance Company in Worcester, Mass., to a stockholder company owned by shareholders from a mutual company, owned by policyholders.
The conversion was previously approved by policyholders of State Mutual, which plans to change its name to First Allmerica Financial Life Insurance and become a subsidiary of Allmerica Financial. As part of the conversion, stock with an estimated value of more than $600 million was distributed to the company's more than 100,000 policyholders.
